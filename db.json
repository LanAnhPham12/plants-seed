      "description": "<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">HOW TO GROW ALOE VERA BARBADENSIS MILLER FROM SEEDS</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Aloe Vera Barbadensis Miller is a versatile and easy-to-grow herb that is highly valued for its therapeutic properties. If you're interested in cultivating this plant from seed, following a few simple steps is essential to ensure optimal growth and success.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Choosing the suitable potting medium is crucial for the health of your Aloe Vera Barbadensis Miller plant. A well-draining medium consisting of half peat and half sand is recommended, as it allows for proper water drainage and prevents root rot. Alternatively, you can start the seeds with perlite, compost, and sand to promote healthy root development.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Aloe Vera Barbadensis Miller seeds can be grown outdoors in warm climates during the summer months. The ideal temperature for the potting medium is around 23 degrees Celsius, and it should be kept moderately moist. It is best to choose a large container to accommodate the growing plant but small enough to allow for easy handling. Flats are a popular choice, as they require less soil and provide a controlled environment for seedlings.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">To germinate the seeds, spread them lightly on the dampened medium and cover them with a light dusting of soil. Many growers prefer to cover the container with plastic lids to maintain high humidity for optimal germination. Keeping the soil moist but not overly wet is essential, as this can cause the seeds to rot. After the seeds have germinated, they can be transplanted into larger containers or moved outside if the weather permits.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Aloe Vera Barbadensis Miller is a hardy plant that requires minimal maintenance once established. It is essential to avoid overwatering and to provide ample sunlight and good air circulation. Regular fertilization can also help promote healthy growth and vibrant foliage.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF ALOE VERA</b></h2>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Once your Aloe Vera Barbadensis Miller seeds have sprouted, ensuring that the soil remains moist but not overly wet is vital. Mist the soil regularly to maintain proper moisture levels, taking care not to drown the seedlings. This process typically takes two to four weeks, depending on the environment.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">To protect the seedlings from desiccation, transplant each one into a 2-inch pot as soon as four or more leaves appear. Alternatively, you can place them in a sunny location with ample sunlight, ideally near a window in the west or south. It is important to note that low-light aloe will tend to grow leggy, so providing sufficient light is essential for optimal growth.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>In the spring and summer, you can help your Aloe Vera Barbadensis Miller plant grow using special plant food. It's called a balanced houseplant formula. But don't use it too much - just once a month is plenty. This will help promote healthy growth and vibrant foliage.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">While watering Aloe Vera Barbadensis Miller can be challenging, it is not complicated. Despite being adapted to arid environments, this plant still requires adequate water to thrive, mainly due to its thick leaves. It is essential to avoid overwatering and to allow the soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF ALOE VERA</b></h2>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">People have relied on Aloe Vera Barbadensis Miller for thousands of years to heal and soften skin. Its use as a folk remedy for various ailments, including constipation and skin disorders, has also been documented throughout history. However, current research into the benefits of aloe vera is mixed. It is important to note that more research is needed to understand this herb's potential risks and benefits thoroughly.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Despite this controversy, many people continue to believe in the healing power of Aloe Vera Barbadensis Miller. This plant has extraordinary things inside it that can help with lots of health problems.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<p><strong><em><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\">Note:</span></em></strong><em> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</em></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></em></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Specifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong>Product Type:</strong> Aloe Vera Barbadensis Miller Seeds</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong>Season:</strong> Any Season</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong>Use:</strong> Hair, Skin, Juice<br>\n</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong>More:</strong> Reproductive</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong>Kingdom:</strong> Plantae</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong>Clade:</strong> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Monocots</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong>Order:</strong> Asparagales</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong>Family:</strong> Asphodelaceae</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong>Subfamily:</strong> Asphodeloideae</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong>Genus:</strong> Aloe</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Under grow lights or in an excellent solar greenhouse, plant plants in a fast-draining mix. Seeds can be sown about five centimetres deep, and the planting area should stay warm and dry. Watering too often seems to discourage germination since the seeds have already swelled up after soaking. Germination may take 3 to 6 weeks. The plants should be transplanted to parts of the garden with rich hills, along with trellising.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>LOU HAN GOU CARE AFTER GERMINATION </strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Monk Fruit alias Luo Han Guo prefers cool ambient temperatures of 20 to 22C.

Also native to us, but rarely and perhaps only to be found by actual herbalists. In the eastern Mediterranean, mandrake is found mainly on rocky slopes. But it can also be found in North Africa, the Middle East, and as far as the Himalayas. Throughout history, legends have sprung up around the roots owing to their appearance and their human-like form.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></div>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">INSTRUCTION FOR SOWING </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">MANDRAKE MANDRAGORA</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Nurturing Mandrake (Mandragora) seeds into vibrant plants requires careful attention and adherence to specific sowing instructions. Follow these guidelines to optimize the germination process and ensure the successful growth of your Mandrake seeds:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Mandrake thrives in light and porous soil with a substantial proportion of sand or gravel. Before sowing, prepare the soil by creating a well-draining mixture that promotes healthy root development.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Cold Stratification:</strong> Mandrake seeds require a simulated cold period to break their dormancy and initiate germination. To achieve this, treating the seeds with a cold stratification technique is recommended. Place the seeds in a container with sand or sterile Cactus substrate and store them in a refrigerator at around 5 degrees Celsius temperature. This simulated cold period will help trigger the germination process.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Mould Prevention:</strong> To safeguard the Mandrake seeds from mould growth during the cold stratification period, using sand or sterile Cactus substrate as the medium is advisable. These materials provide a well-drained environment that discourages mould formation.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Sowing in Autumn:</strong> Once the cold stratification process is complete and autumn arrives, planting the Mandrake seeds directly into the prepared soil is time. Choose a suitable location with adequate sunlight and gently press the seeds into the soil at a shallow depth.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Moisture and Care</strong>: Ensure the soil remains consistently moist but not soggy. Regularly monitor the moisture levels and adjust watering accordingly. Providing a balanced environment with sufficient moisture is crucial to facilitate seed germination.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Patience and Monitoring:</strong> Germination of Mandrake seeds can be slow and gradual, requiring patience. Keep a close eye on the planted seeds, maintaining appropriate moisture levels and providing necessary care. Be prepared for a more extended germination period, which can take several weeks or months.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">By diligently following these instructions, you can increase the chances of successful Mandrake seed germination and cultivate thriving Mandrake plants. Remember to exercise patience throughout the process and appreciate these beautiful plants' unique beauty as they unfold.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">ALTERNATIVE SOWING AND CARE GUIDELINE</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is also possible to sow seeds in pots in October as an alternative to direct sowing. It's best to keep them outdoors during the winter in an area that is protected. In this case, the substrate mustn't dry out. The germination can take up to 12 months. After the seeds have germinated, expose the containers to fluorescent lights or grow lights. It would be best not to depend on direct sunlight from a window, as it might be too cool at night or too hot in the daytime. The roots of the mandrake should be large enough to survive outdoors once the roots have grown.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #3dce00;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #3dce00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #3dce00;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #3dce00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.<br></span></em></p>\n<p><meta charset=\"UTF-8\"><span><strong><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"></span></strong></span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong> Product: </strong>Mandrake Seeds,  Mandragora officinarum<br><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Autumn</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 6 through 8</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 2 - 6 inches</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloom Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Sandy, Moist</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 20 Degree Celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Solanales</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span></strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Solanaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Mandragora </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> M. officinarum</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries:</strong> 3-7 working days. <br>Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world:</strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br>Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.</p>\n</div>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></span><br>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Remove any dust or debris attached to the Moso bamboo seeds by placing them in a strainer and rinsing them with cool water. Soak the seeds in clear water for 15 minutes, and drain them to dry. Mix equal parts perlite and peat moss. Moisten the mixture until you can grab a handful and barely squeeze out a drop. Fill a flat planter box with the soil mixture. Plant a sprinkling of seeds along each row of rows of soil mix about 2.5 cm deep. About ten seeds should be sown in the hole. These holes should be added to the mixed surface. Mix fine soil over the seeds. Put the lid on the box and move it to a quiet spot. Now let's know how to care for germination.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR THE GERMINATION OF MOSO BAMBOO</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Make sure to remove the lid every three days to give the plants fresh air. The soil mix must be moistened if it has become dry during this time. Place the lid on the mixture after it has been watered. Remove the lid permanently after the seedlings reach the lid inside. It will take two to three weeks for the first Moso Bamboo seedlings to sprout, and the seeds will continue to grow until they have all emerged. According to the package directions, mix a houseplant fertilizer all-purpose. Pour the fertilizer into a clean spray bottle and mist the plants once they are four weeks old. You can transplant seedlings into individual pots after they have been growing for a month.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">WHAT IS MOSO BAMBOO?</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Phyllostachys edulis, the giant bamboo in China which grows to 6-11 meters tall, is also known as Moso bamboo. Moso Bamboo plants are usually propagated by splitting them into clumps and planting them individually since bamboo flowers and seeds so infrequently, often spending 50 years between seeding seasons. You can start your own bamboo forest with no more effort than it takes to grow any other plant if you have some Moso bamboo seeds. You will receive 100 fresh seeds of the giant bamboo Phyllostachys Moso including cultivation instructions. It is possible to raise children throughout the year. These bamboos have blue-green stalks and whitish sebum on them.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>\n<strong> Product:</strong> Moso Bamboo Seeds, Phyllostachys<br><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Drainage: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moist but Well-Drained</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil pH:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Acid, Alkaline, Neutral</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Chalk, Loam</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plant Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Bamboos</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: March-April</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 6-7</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Monocot, Commelinids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Poales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Poaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Phyllostachys </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">P. edulis</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-7 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

You will receive healthy and ready to germinate seeds from Garden Paradise Seeds. It would help if you filled a cup or small pot with a sterile seed starter or cactus soil mix. Wet the soil but avoid soaking it. The spoon is used to mix the seed into the top quarter-inch of soil. Mist this layer as needed to ensure it's moist, and then cover it with plastic sandwich bags or clear plastic wrap. By keeping moisture and warmth in, the cover will retain heat. It would be best if you now waited until the seeds germinated.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF PITAYA DRAGON FRUIT</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In cooler climates, dragon fruit is ideal for containers. To grow as a container plant, transplant the seedlings into a pot with good drainage and use a cactus soil mix or one you create by blending sand and potting soil. Both compounds can be amended with compost. As soon as the dragon fruit reaches 20 cm in height, please put it in a pot at least 50 cm wide and 70 cm deep. Add a trellis or climbing pole to the pot and tie the plant to the support. Due to this plant's climbing nature, dragon fruits also require sturdier supports outside or an arbor.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PITAYA WHITE DRAGON FRUIT u0026amp; ITS BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p>Discover the remarkable qualities of Pitaya White Dragon Fruit and the advantages it offers. This fruit boasts antioxidant properties attributed to its rich vitamin C content. Moreover, dragon fruit is an excellent source of iron, playing a crucial role in oxygen distribution and energy generation within the body.

We anticipate that the Red Dragon Fruit seeds we supply from Garden Paradise Seeds will proliferate, typically within a few days, though some groups may need up to eight weeks. Make sure the soil is moist and sterile before planting the seeds. Maintain soil temperatures between 70 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Excellent soils will significantly delay seed germination time and may inhibit germination completely. The dragon fruit seeds are tiny and fragile, so they must be handled carefully. While watering, be careful not to disturb the soil as seeds can become deeply buried, failing to reach the surface and rotting.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF PITAYA</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Dragon fruit requires warmth, moisture, and plenty of light to thrive. During the hottest day hours, select a garden bed with full sun or light shade and deep, organically rich soil that drains well. When mature, dragon fruit can grow to more than 20 feet tall, making a trellis or pergola an essential support structure. Plant dragon fruit at least 400-500cm away from structures, power lines, and trees to prevent damage. During the growing season, dragon fruit requires regular irrigation during periods of drought.  </span></p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">RED DRAGON FRUIT u0026amp; ITS BENEFITS</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span>\n</h2>\n<p>Uncover the allure of the Red Dragon Fruit, Pitaya, a tropical delicacy characterized by its striking red exterior and delectably sweet pulp adorned with tiny seeds.

Gently remove them from any packaging and inspect them for any damage or deformities. Discard any unhealthy-looking seeds.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Choose the Right Location:</strong> Yellow Dragon Fruit plants thrive in sunny areas with at least six hours of sunlight daily. If you're planting them outdoors, make sure to select a spot with good sunlight exposure. If growing indoors, place them near a sunny windowsill or use grow lights to provide sufficient light.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Select Well-Draining Soil:</strong> Use a well-draining potting mix that is rich in organic matter. Dragon Fruit plants don't like waterlogged soil, so a mixture that allows excess water to drain away is essential.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Planting the Seeds:</strong> Scatter the Yellow Dragon Fruit seeds across the soil surface. They don't need to be buried deeply; just gently press them into the soil or cover them with a thin layer of soil. Make sure the water can barely cover the seeds.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Watering:</strong> Water the seeds lightly after planting to settle them into the soil. Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to rot. Allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Temperature and Humidity</strong>: Dragon Fruit seeds prefer warm temperatures and a humid environment. If you're growing them indoors, you may want to use a humidity dome or cover the pots with plastic wrap until the seeds germinate.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Germination:</strong> Dragon Fruit seeds can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to germinate. Be patient and keep the soil consistently moist during this period. Once the seedlings emerge, you can remove the humidity dome or plastic wrap.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transplanting</strong> can be done when the seedlings have grown a few inches tall and have a few sets of true leaves. At this stage, they can be moved to separate pots or the ground if they are outside. It is important to use a potting mix that drains well for the new containers. Use a potting mix that drains well for the new containers.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Provide Support</strong>: As the Yellow Dragon Fruit plants grow, they will need support to climb or spread out. You can provide a trellis or other support structure for them to cling to.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<strong>Maintenance:</strong> Regularly water your Yellow Dragon Fruit plants, especially during dry periods. Fertilize them every few months with a balanced fertilizer to encourage healthy growth.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Patience:</strong> Keep in mind that growing Yellow Dragon Fruit from seeds may take several years before the plant matures and produces fruit. Be patient and enjoy the process of nurturing your plant.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember that each seed is unique, and not all seeds may germinate successfully. By following these steps and providing the right conditions, you increase the chances of successfully growing Yellow Dragon Fruit from seeds.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\">Care for and After Germination of Yellow Dragon Fruit</h2>\n<p>This guide will assist you in caring for your Yellow Dragon Fruit plants after they have sprouted. The purpose is to ensure that they grow successfully and produce delicious fruit.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Regular Watering:</strong> Water is crucial for the growth of Dragon Fruit seedlings. Ensure the soil bed remains evenly moist by providing regular watering. Check the top inch of the soil; if it feels dry to the touch, it's time to water. However, be cautious not to overwater, as it may lead to root rot. Strike a balance to maintain adequate moisture levels.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Soil Moisture Management:</strong> If your soil tends to dry out quickly, consider covering the soil bed with plastic wrap until the seeds germinate. This helps retain moisture and creates a favorable environment for germination. Once the seedlings emerge, remove the plastic wrap to allow for proper air circulation.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Thinning Out: </strong>As your Yellow Dragon Fruit seedlings grow, they may become overcrowded. To promote healthier growth, thin out the seedlings by removing weaker or crowded plants. This will provide more space and resources for the remaining seedlings to flourish.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transplanting for Indoor Growth:</strong> If you're growing your seedlings indoors and they outgrow their initial containers, it's time to transplant them into larger pots. Choose well-draining potting mix and provide enough space for the roots to develop. Transplanting ensures the plants have enough room to mature and develop into healthy specimens.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sunlight Requirements:</strong> Yellow Dragon Fruit thrives in sunny environments. Ensure your plants receive a minimum of six hours of sunlight daily. If you're growing them indoors, position the pots near a sunny windowsill or use artificial grow lights to supplement natural sunlight.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fertilization:</strong> To support healthy growth, provide your Yellow Dragon Fruit plants with occasional fertilization. Use a balanced fertilizer and apply it every few months during the growing season. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for proper application rates to avoid over-fertilization.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Support and Pruning: </strong>As the plants grow, they will need support to climb or spread out. Provide a trellis, stake, or other support structure for the plants to cling to as they mature. Additionally, consider pruning the plants to encourage branching and a more compact shape. Pinching back the tips of new growth will promote bushiness.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Pest and Disease Management: </strong>Keep a watchful eye for pests such as aphids and mealybugs, which can affect Dragon Fruit plants. Promptly address any infestations using appropriate methods. Proper drainage is crucial to prevent root rot, so ensure your soil has good drainage to avoid this issue.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><strong>YELLOW DRAGON FRUIT WITH BENEFITS</strong></h2>\n<p>Explore the fascinating charm of Yellow Dragon Fruit, a unique type from the Selenicereus megalanthus species.

Sow seed in clean, fresh compost and lightly cover. Germinate at around 25.5oC and keep the seeds moist. Continue to grow as necessary, gradually increasing the size of the pots with John Innes No 2 or similar peat-based compost. I recommend ending up in a larger container, like a half barrel or something similar. To avoid water logging, make sure that whatever you use has a good drainage system. It takes between three and five weeks for germination to occur. Transplant seedlings in the same way as you would conventional tomatoes. </span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THE TAMARILLO TREE</strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As long as the soil drains well, tree tomatoes tolerate a wide variety of soil conditions, though compost-enriched soil is preferred. Also, the tamarillo tree tomato requires full sun, although it can be planted partially shaded in hotter climates. Due to the shallow root system of these trees, adequate wind protection may also be necessary, such as near the house. You will need to water your tomato tree as much as your tomato plants. Mulching around trees aids in retaining moisture. Take these steps to care for your tomato tree plants so you get the best results.</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">KNOW ABOUT TAMARILLO FRUIT</b></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Tamarillo comes from Peru and is related to the tomato, potato, eggplant, and other nightshade plants. It does not grow hardy on our site but will grow in a container overwintering in a greenhouse or winter garden. The plant produces numerous egg-shaped, yellow-red to purple-coloured fruits, which are reminiscent of passion fruit, from the second to third year. You can enjoy them once they succumb to finger pressure. </span></p>\n<strong></strong>\n</div>\n<p><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\" data-mce-style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\" data-mce-style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\"><em><span style=\"color: #e91e1e;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #e91e1e;\"><strong>Note:</strong></span> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</em></span></span></span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Specifications:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Season:</strong><span> Summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>USDA Zones:</strong><span> 10-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Days to Harvest:</strong><span> 60-</span>80 days</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Height:</strong><span> 10-18</span> feet</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Soil Type:</strong><span> Moist</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Temperature:</strong><span> 1</span>0 degrees Celcius</li>\n<li>\n<b>Uses: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ice creams or sorbets and serve cooked fish, make sauces or chutney</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>More:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Reproductive</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Kingdom</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Clade:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Order:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solanales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Family:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solanaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Genus:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solanum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Species:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> S. betaceum</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\" data-mce-style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-7 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Ideally, Banana Passionfruit should plant seeds in moist, well-draining soil 5 cm to 15 cm deep. Keep soil temperature consistent at 20-25 Degrees Celsius. The germination of seeds occurs more slowly when soils are cool, or not at all if the soil is too cold. Germination time under optimal conditions may take six weeks to a few months. Sometimes it takes a year for seeds to sprout.</span></p>\n<h2><b>CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF TAXO CURUBA</b></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The transplanted seedlings need to be trained onto a horizontal trellis approximately 2 meters high and 40 cm apart after transplant. Banana Passionfruit will produce the first crop in 2 years. It is essential to water passionfruit vines regularly, especially when they are young, flowering, and fruiting. Water deeply a couple of times a week, depending on weather conditions and climate.</span></p>\n<h2><b>USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF BANANA PASSIONFRUIT</b></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Usually, banana passion fruit is used to make desserts such as pies and cakes or to make relishes, jams, and other preserves.

Seeds can be sown from March through May or from August through September. You can make it easier to handle by mixing horticultural sand with a small amount of the seed. Seed should be thinly sprinkled on seed trays with very little or no cover. It is best to place in a propagator that can be heated or covered with a polythene bag and kept at 20 degrees Celsius. Germination should take place within two weeks. When the plants are large enough, transplant them into small pots. To avoid the need for pricking out, thyme can be sewn several times to a plug tray. After thyme plants reach a height of about 5cm, 'harden off' for 3-4 days u0026amp; plant them outdoors once the frost danger has passed. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">THYME PURPLE CREEPING </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It would be best if you watered seedlings from the bottom and kept them moist at all times to prevent damping off. A perennial woody plant, thyme needs to be divided every three years to maintain fresh vigor after five years. Cuttings can be taken as needed, but replacing them is difficult. When picked at all, it should be very lightly picked in its first year, but if possible, leave alone in the first year and pick in the second year. The crop can be harvested year-round, but in winter only lightly as it is not growing. It is possible to pick it all year round once established.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">WHAT IS THYME CREEPER?</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This Purple Thyme has a creeping habit, forming mats, usually becoming 10cm in height. Purple flowers decorate this plant. They are used both ornamentally and for culinary purposes. This plant contains thymol, which is highly beneficial for killing microorganisms. Furthermore, it is very effective at treating hypertension and lowering blood pressure. Additionally, this herb has been shown to treat breast and colon cancer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #009f1f;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sowing Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">3 - 6 cm</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 12 Months</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloom Time:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> June to July</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Zone</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 4 to 8</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asteroids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Lamiales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Lamiaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Thymus</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">T. serpyllum</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

We will send you healthy seeds. Then you need to sow them 2.5-5cm deep in good soil in groups of four seeds. As a general rule, groups should be spaced 100-150cm apart, with rows 250cm apart. A little water every day is enough. When leaves appear on the Ash Gourd creeper, thin seedlings to 5 cm or 7 cm in each group, keeping their fruits off the ground, Ash Gourds grow well on trellises and supports. Seedlings can be planted in trays, in pots, or on the ground. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF ASH GOURD</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Indoors, ash gourds can be grown very quickly, but they require patience. A warm temperate climate is best for growing Ash Gourd, but it cannot tolerate frost. Therefore, do not try to grow in winter. As Ash Gourd creepers grow, flowering begins fifty to one hundred days after sowing. Around a week after the flowers have appeared, immature gourds can also be seen. Immature gourds show a little more care, but they're also edible when cooked. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">ASH GOURD AND ITS BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ash gourd is a native of Japan and is widely found throughout India and Bangladesh.

It belongs to the Gardenia jasminoides group. You should choose a sunny or partially shaded site. If Gardenias get too much sunlight, they may scorch, and their buds may fall off, even though they prefer full sun. Gardenias grow well in hot climates if they receive more morning sun than afternoon shade. In spring, remember to sow. Then cover the seed with a quarter-inch of soil, tamp it securely and keep it moist and warm until germination, which can take 30 to 60 days. Work seedlings up in successively larger pots until they are large enough to withstand the rigors of the landscape. Maintain a minimum distance of three feet between shrubs.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">GARDENIA JASMINOIDES</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It would be best to properly take care of the plants to achieve the best result, but we will guide you. Ensure that the growing medium has been thoroughly soaked when watering the gardenia. Consider watering twice weekly for the first six weeks after planting. Soil should then be allowed to dry between waterings. When watering, thoroughly soak the soil. Every week, the gardens need at least one inch of rain. Keep the soil consistently damp but not soggy.

Plants from this genus can be grown in containers in rooms, conservatories, or greenhouses. Plants can also be grown outside in summer. The seeds can be grown indoors all year round. People take gardenia by mouth for anxiety, agitation, bladder infection, bleeding, cancer, constipation, depression, diabetes, fever, gallbladder disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, the flu, trouble sleeping, liver disorders, menopausal symptoms, pain, swelling of the pancreas, and rheumatoid arthritis.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>\n<strong>Product:</strong> Gardenia Jasminoides Seeds</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 10-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Bloom:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 60-80 days.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-6' tall</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Moist</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 16 degrees Celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Gentianales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rubiaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Gardenia </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> G. jasminoides</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Use:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Beneficial For Most Disease</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-7 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.</p>\n</div>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Take some pots with the moistened seed-starting compost and press the compost into the pot to remove any trapped air. Place two black bamboo seeds on the surface of the seed-starting compost. Cover the seeds with a thick layer of compost. Spritz each pot with a water-filled spray bottle to settle the seed-starting compost around the black bamboo seeds. Place near a large window with very bright, filtered light. Set the temperature up to 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Moisten the seed-starting compost with the spray bottle whenever it feels dry on the surface. Do not let the seed-starting compost dry out; the seeds can take a few months to germinate.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF DENDROCALAMUS STRICTUS</strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Dendrocalamus Strictus, the Big Bamboo, can grow under varying light conditions, from full sun to partial shade. Black Big Bamboos look beautiful in pots and containers, but Bamboo Dendrocalamus should plant them in the garden once the seeds are germinated. Plant the little black bamboo in fertile, well-draining soil in either sun or part shade. A spot that offers some protection from the hot afternoon sun is ideal. Space plants are at least 150 cm apart if you are planting for a hedge or screen. It will take only about five or six years for them to reach their full height. Wait only a few years to see the beautiful bamboo. </span></p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">BENEFITS AND BEAUTY OF </span></strong><strong>DENDROCALAMUS STRICTUS</strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Black Bamboo is one of the most beautiful bamboo species in this world. Its plants are considered highly ornamental for their culms, transitioning from green to ebony black by the third year of growth. The leaves of black bamboo are evergreen, bright green, and lanceolate in shape. The leaves of the black bamboo trees are antipyretic and diuretic. These leaves can be great for the treatment of fevers, vomiting, and nosebleeds. It would help to harvest Black Bamboo during the growing season and then dry leaves for later use.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Necessities</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Well Watered</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Time needs:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 4-5 years</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Acidic</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plant height</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 100cm</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Specific:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Well Drained, Alkaline</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><br></h4>\n</div>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries:</strong> 3-7 working days. <br>Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world:</strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br>Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.</p>\n</div>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></span><br>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

It should then be placed in a baggie, cloth bag, or glass jar. Your seeds will germinate faster if you add seaweed to their growing medium. It can germinate seeds due to its naturally occurring growth hormones. In addition, damping-off can be prevented. Now you can store the jar or bag in the refrigerator. You will want to keep them in there for up to 60 days. By creating a winter-like environment, you break the dormancy of seeds. Keep them from freezing while they are moist, however. Here are some ways to ensure germination.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR THE GERMINATION OF HERB COMFREY</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Please keep them in the refrigerator. You can plant outside as soon as the soil temperature reaches 68 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Ideally, your seeds should be planted in a greenhouse or sunny window for the best germination results. Try maintaining a soil temperature of 68 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit while your seeds are thinking about sprouting. Heat lamps or heat pads for horticulture can be used if needed. A temperature of 70 to 80 degrees can be set on the thermostat. You will soon see your seeds sprout with your perfect environment now created.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SOME MORE CARE GUIDES FOR COMFREY</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The plant can grow in various conditions and requires very little maintenance. After you dig up a mature plant, any roots left in the soil will likely sprout, so if you like to control its spread, grow it in either a container or raised garden bed rather than in the ground. In this case, removing the spent blooms promptly will prevent the plant from spreading its seeds. Plants need a lot of nitrogen to flower well and look good, as does the plant comfrey. If the plant's stems are cut back after it flowers, it will also proliferate. And yeah! Ideally, spring and summer are the most suitable times to sow.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Note:</span></em></strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Comfrey Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sowing Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Spring, Summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sunlight:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Full sun to partial shade</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Maturity:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 20-40 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 30-90cm</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Loamy</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Use: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">bruises, sprains</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">More:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Reproductive</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Boraginales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Boraginaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Symphytum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: S. officinale</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Information:</span></strong></h4>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ireland u0026amp; Northern Ireland:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Orders placed before 4 p.m. will be delivered the next day, otherwise usually two working days. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> From 2,00 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rest of the World :</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-11 Working Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From 2,90 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">- Except</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> for Australia u0026amp; New Zealand, shipping costs are 3.50 Euros.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at<span> </span></span><b>Garden Paradise Seeds</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are dedicated to providing the best quality products with the best customer service in the entire market.

The seeds you will buy from us will germinate quickly. Since Passion Fruit seeds lose viability fast, Yellow Passionfruit is usually grown from newly collected seeds. Plant seeds 1.5-2.5 cm deep in shaded beds. Transplant 25 cm tall seedlings in full sun in well-drained organic soil rich in organic matter with true leaves. You have to provide strong trellis support for vine and fruit growth. If you plant the seeds immediately, they will germinate within 10 to 20 days.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF YELLOW PASSION FRUIT</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yellow Passion Fruit needs a regular supply of water and nutrients. Overwatering can, however, lead to root problems. Don't be afraid to sprinkle on a balanced, organic, slow-release fertilizer from time to time. Here is a trick! For the pollination of Passionfruit, bees are the only sources. The best way to help your passionfruit is to plant many herbs and flowers in your garden that attract bees. The Yellow Passionfruit can only be pollinated by another cultivar, which is mostly incompatible with itself. Yellow Passion can be grown in this way.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PASSIONFLOWER u0026amp; ITS BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yellow Passion Flower, Passiflora Yulia Sims, is a climbing plant with flowers that can reach a diameter of 9 cm. As a houseplant and an outdoor plant, the passionflower is easy to care for. Young plants are frost hardy to -15 degrees, older plants to -20 degrees. The plant is perennial. Waterlogging and excessive sunlight are not suitable for the passionflower. The fruits are 5-9 cm. long and edible.

It would help if you planted the seeds of Rue Peganum harmala in the greenhouse late in the spring for the best results. If you scatter thinly over a stable, moist seed mix surface and tamp them down, you can reliably germinate Pergamum harmala seeds. Keep in a little bit of filtered sun and maintain moisture. The temperature should be kept warm. Keep young seeds in their place, even crowded ones, since disturbing them can be fatal. Remember that Syrian Rue likes a well-drained, not too damp, and not too-rich medium. Darkness is essential for the seeds to germinate. The temperature should be around 21 degrees Celsius, 70 degrees Fahrenheit.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span><br>\n</div>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION PEGANUM HARMALA</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Do not overwater, especially when the plants are dormant. Late spring or early summer is the ideal time for planting. Syrian Rue requires full sun and well-drained, dry, poor soil. It will go limp and die if the roots become too wet since the remaining roots can't cope with evaporation. If you grow the plant too rich, the growth will be too lush and soft and become very susceptible to fungus infection and bug damage. Plants grown in low light produce thin, flopping growth that blows over quickly and dries out rapidly during droughts.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HEALTH BENEFITS OF SYRIAN RUE</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Syrian Rue (Peganum harmala) is a perennial shrub that can grow up to approximately 1 meter in height. It produces beautiful flowers that bloom during the period from April to May. Beyond its ornamental value, Syrian Rue also offers notable health benefits when used responsibly.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Oral Usage:</strong> Traditionally, Syrian Rue has been consumed orally to address specific health concerns.

However, homeowners do not typically plant blue gum because of its immense size. Begin the blue gum seed germination process in early February. Moisten the sand to the point that it completely buries the seeds. Upon maturing, transplant into small pots and again in a prepared garden row.  <br><br></span></div>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HOW TO CARE </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">EUCALYPTUS GLOBULUS </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">AFTER GERMINATION </span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p>you can directly sow eucalyptus globulus tree seeds into the container where the plant will grow. Also, you can fill a pot with perlite and place the plant in the medium with the rooting hormone end exposed. Tasmanian blue gums are extremely rare houseplants that require regular watering to grow. They do best in long-lasting, direct light and should be less than 1 foot from a window. Tasmanian blue gums prefer well-draining soil. Consider adding a gentle, organic fertilizer during the peak growing season.</p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF EUCALYPTUS GLOBULUS SEEDS</span></strong></h2>\n<p>Eucalyptus Tree has been harvested and distilled since the 19th century and is acknowledged as a very effective decongestant remedy for upper respiratory infections and inflammatory infections, such as bronchitis, and a topical ointment for aches, skin problems, and even a complimenting and enhancing antibiotics use. Despite eucalyptus tea's safety, ingesting eucalyptus oil can be toxic in relatively low doses. You should always consult your healthcare provider if you take any medications before using eucalyptus oil.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Eucalyptus Globulus Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zone: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">9-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rare Houseplant</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fertile, Well-drained</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Eucalyptus globulus, Tasmanian Blue gum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Higher classification: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Eucalyptus</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Myrtales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Myrtaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rank: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Use:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Houseplant, Tea, Oil</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

To ensure that strawberry seeds will grow, they must be stratified before planting. To do this, put the strawberry seeds in an envelope or sealed plastic bag and store them in the refrigerator for a month. Since strawberry seeds need to be planted by February to prepare for harvest, start stratification in January. Stratification is necessary for some seeds before sprouting. During cold stratification, you mimic the conditions a seed might experience in nature. After reaching through the stratification process, put the seeds 1/2 inch deep into a container filled with sterile seed-starting mix. Press the seeds gently into the surface without covering them.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR WHITE STRAWBERRIES AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Light is necessary for strawberry seeds to germinate. Within one to six weeks, the seeds will germinate. They transplant the seeds into larger containers six weeks after their germination is recommended. An extra six weeks, your strawberry seedlings are ready to plant outside. You can harden off your strawberry seedlings by placing them in protected areas for half an hour at a time. Slowly increase the time the plants spend outside. The seedlings should be transplanted into the garden once hardened off. Space them two feet separated, and be sure to plant them in well-drained and acidic soil. Strawberries need full sun to grow. While they are in bloom, you should water them at least an inch a week. Strawberry plants do not have deep roots, so they do not require deep soil to grow.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF WHITE STRAWBERRIES</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As well as adding strawberries to smoothies, sorbets, pies, jello, and salads, strawberries can also be incorporated into different recipes. Children love strawberries because of their flavour and colour; mothers love them because they allow them to experiment with different foods and make them look extra tasty. These potent little packages protect your heart, increase HDL (good) cholesterol, lower your blood pressure, and guard against cancer. Strawberries are low in calories and are rich in vitamins, fibre, and polyphenol antioxidants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> White Strawberry Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zone: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">5-8</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Phytophthora fragariae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Higher classification:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Phytophthora</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Pot Growing Fruit</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fertile, Acidic Soil</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Harvest Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">4-6 Weeks</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Phylum: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Oomycota</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Peronosporaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">F. × ananassa</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Use:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Salad or Cake</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br>Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br>Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Seeds of the Carolina reaper should be placed in sterile media and covered one centimeter deep. After that, provide 25 degrees celsius bottom heat with a seedling heat mat, along with bright light, and keep the seeds moist at all times. Typically, seeds will germinate in one to three weeks. However, be patient as this process can sometimes take longer. When the Carolina reaper seedlings sprout, you should brush them with your hands or blow a fan on them every day. Seedlings benefit from this because the stems are strengthened and damping-off is prevented.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR CAROLINA REAPER AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After the Carolina Reaper seedlings are a few inches tall with a few sets of leaves, transplant them into pots and grow them until there are six true leaves on the plant. You can start bringing them outdoors once both the daytime and nighttime temperatures get warm enough. Harden off your plants by leaving them out in the sun each day for a couple of hours, working up to leaving them outside for a couple of full days before planting. Transplant them directly into containers of rich soil, and grow them in full sunlight. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF CAROLINA REAPER</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As a sweet flavoring and intense heat, Carolina Reaper chile peppers are most often added to hot sauces and salsas. Peppers can be blended into sauces to flavor chicken wings, cooked meats, pasta, Asian noodle dishes, chilis, stews, and soups. Including them in cheese and red meat dishes is worth it since they're high in carotene, a powerful antioxidant that supports lower cholesterol and triglycerides.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0a9919;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #0a9919;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Carolina Reaper Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">8-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 100 Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Loamy</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">20-22° Degrees C</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Heat: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Exceptionally hot</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Origin: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fort Mill, South Carolina, US</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Higher classification: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Capsicum chinense</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Capsicum chinense 'Carolina Reaper'</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hybrid parentage: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ghost Pepper x Habanero</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rank: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cultivar</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Beneficial Vegetable</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Henbane is found in fields, roadside ditches, meadows, and roadsides. Waterlogged soil is the only condition it won't accept. The soil must be well-drained, but it doesn't mind the full sun. Plant them far away from your home and outdoor living areas because they emit a foul odour. </span></p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">BLACK HENBANE </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">AND ITS BENEFITS</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Black Henbane (Hyoscyamus niger) is a herb with a rich historical background and notable characteristics.

If you're planting indoors, begin three to four weeks before the last frost date, or start them outdoors in the spring after the later frost date. As long as you've got eight weeks before the first frost, you can plant borage successionally all summer long. The plant can bolt more quickly and go to seed in hot weather. Borage seeds can be thrown on top of the soil, or any hole you poke every 12 inches can be filled with seed. Seedlings can be started indoors by placing one or two seeds in each cell, then covering the cells with soil. Borage should water seeds gently to avoid disturbing them.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF HERB BORAGE </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Borage requires regular water until it is established. Watering the soil can become difficult after establishment. Borage needs no nutrition; fertile soil will prevent blooming. To boost flowering plants, use compost tea or a dilute fish emulsion solution. If you want your plants to grow bushy, pinch them back when they reach 6 inches in height. After about midsummer, cut the borage leaves by half to promote new, tender leaves. When temperatures drop below freezing, borage will die back. Borage can survive mild winters and flower again next year.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SOME TIPS AND TRICKS FOR HERB BORAGE </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The borage seeds must be sown every four weeks for that flower to grow. As long as you choose to pick them whenever you want, you can use them fresh. As a result of being harvested, the leaves retain more of their distinctive flavor, making them more suitable for consumption than dried leaves. When you host a honeybee colony, do not disturb the flowers. It is possible to obtain excellent honey from these blooms.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Note:</span></em></strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Borage Seeds | Borago Officinalis</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sowing Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">February to April.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sunlight:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Full sun to partial shade</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Maturity:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 55-75 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 18 to 36 inches</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Spacing:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 12 to 24 inches apart</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 20 degrees Celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Benefits:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> hyperactive gastrointestinal, respiratory, and cardiovascular disorders</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">More:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Reproductive</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Boraginales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Boraginaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Borago</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: B.

Prepare well-drained, sandy soil for planting your seeds. Containers are suitable because they can be brought indoors if it is chilly. You can also consider planting Naranjilla outdoors if you live in a warm region. Maintain moisture in the soil by covering the top with grit and keeping it moist. The process of growing Naranjilla from seed sometimes requires patience. To propagate naranjilla seeds, you may have to wait for the seeds to sprout, at times for much longer.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span><br>\n</div>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE ABOUT SOWING LULO PLUM SEEDS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sow more than one naranjilla seed per pot if you want to ensure at least one sprouts when you plant them in containers. It's best to leave only the most vigorous seedlings if you have multiple sprouts per pot. More patience is required for the fruit. The first step in propagating naranjilla seeds is to plant the seeds. Usually, it takes a year for the fruit to appear after seeding. However, here's the good news: it fruits for three years, over 100 fruits each year. It's exciting.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">KNOW ABOUT SOLANUM QUITOENSE YOU'LL HAVE</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Solanum quitoense, Naranjilla seeds. Lulo means \"little orange\" in Spanish, and Naranjilla means \"little orange\" in English. It tastes like pineapple and lemon mixture. A 3 to 6 cm fruit resembling an orange does indeed grow in these plants. The juicy orange fruits are reminiscent of melon in taste. Perennial evergreen shrubs can reach up to three meters in height. It is suitable as a container plant but can also be planted outdoors in summer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Naranjilla Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Seeds per pack: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">5 seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">3 Years Fruit</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sowing time:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Good in Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Time:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> One year 100 fruits</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Juice or for a drink called Teulada.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Use: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Ornamental vine and as a fruit crop.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">More:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Reproductive</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Solanales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Solanaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Solanum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: S. quitoense</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-7 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

The plants will rot if planted on wet ground. Cover the seeds with a sprinkling of vermiculite or finely sieved compost. During germination, the seed tray can be sealed in a clear polythene bag or placed inside a propagator at a temperature of 21-25°C for up to 21 days. Keep the compost damp but not wet and do not exclude light as this helps germination. When handling the seedlings, transplant them into 7.5cm pots and grow lavender plants at a cooler temperature until well established.</p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION  OF </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">LAVENDER VERA</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It would be best to water your Lavender Vera plants regularly until they are established during their first growing season. This is especially important during periods of hot, dry weather. Lavender tolerates droughts reasonably well once it has been established. Lavender enjoys free-draining soil in full sun. A well-established plant can withstand chalky soils as well as dry conditions. As a seedling grows into a plant, you don't need to worry much when it comes to caring for Lavender Vera.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">LAVENDER VERA USES AND BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are versatile uses of Lavender. A cake flavoured with lavender tastes delicious. Add a few leaves to the sugar jar to make jams, jellies, sorbets, biscuits, and other sweet treats. Additionally, Lavender is well known for its calming properties and can be used to make homemade soap, candles, and bath oils that can help you unwind and fall asleep at night. Consider putting a few stems and using them as natural air fresheners instead of plug-ins or chemical air fresheners. A delicious sauce can be created by combining lavender flowers with vegetable stock. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Product: </strong>Lavandula Lavender Vera</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 13-18 C</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sow seeds:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> May - July</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mature Height: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">30cm tall</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mature Spread: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">24-30\" wide</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloom Time:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Division:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Magnoliophyta </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Class:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Magnoliopsida </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Lamiales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Lamiaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lavandula</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Beneficial Herb</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-7 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

We recommend using coco pellets soaked in water and placed in plastic pots for sowing. Cover the seeds with a thin layer of peat (approximately 2 mm) and sow the seeds on the peat pellets. As much tap water as possible should be poured into the ziplock bag, along with a few drops of universal fertilizer, so that after the substrate has been absorbed, a few millimeters of water remain on the bottom. Once the ziplock bag is closed, seal it. There is no need to water more since no moisture evaporates through the ziplock bag. Depending on the species, it will take between 10 and 40 days for bamboo seeds to germinate. You can also make a greenhouse.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR GIANT BAMBOO AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ensure the greenhouse receives more than ten hours of indirect sunlight per day. For seeds to become seedlings, they will need sunlight. Put your greenhouse away from direct sunlight to prevent seeds from being burned. Covering your conservatory with a lid would help keep it warm. Transplant them into larger planting containers once the seedlings are a month old. Plant the seedlings in a hole in the potting soil specifically designed for plants in an open-soil garden.

The seed-starting compost should be moistened and pressed into the pots to remove any air trapped inside. Seed-starting compost should be covered with two giant bamboo seeds. Ensure the seeds are completely covered with compost. Spray water into each pot to settle the seed-starting compost around the bamboo seeds. The pots should be placed near a window with excellent, natural light. The temperature should be maintained at 20 degrees celsius. The seed-starting compost should be moistened with a spray bottle whenever it feels dry on the surface. Seed-starting compost should not be allowed to dry out; seeds can take a few months to germinate.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF DENDROCALAMUS PECULIARIS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Giant Bamboo, Dendrocalamus peculiaris, can grow in varying light conditions, from full sun to partial shade. Giant Bamboos look lovely in pots or containers, but Bamboo Dendrocalamus should plant the seeds directly in the garden once the seeds germinate. Bamboos should be planted in fertile, well-draining soil, either in full sun or partial shade. The best location is one that provides some protection from the hot afternoon sun. If you are planting for a hedge or screen, space the plants at least 150 cm apart. To reach their full height, it will take only five or six years. You will see the beautiful bamboo only in a few years. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">BENEFITS AND BEAUTY OF DENDROCALAMUS PECULIARIS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The bamboo species found on this planet are among the most beautiful. Plant culms change from green to ebony black by the third year of growth, making them highly ornamental. Evergreen, lanceolate, and bright green, the giant bamboo leaves look like tiny sprigs of grass. There are antipyretic and diuretic properties in the leaves of bamboo trees. You can use these leaves to treat fevers, vomiting, and nosebleeds. Giant Bamboo leaves can be harvested during the growing season and dried for later use.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #00b443;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Giant Striped Bamboo Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spring</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span></strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 4-8</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 60 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Loamy, well-drained soil</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">20-25 Degrees C</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific Name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bambusa vulgaris</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Monocots, Commelinids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Poales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Poaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subfamily: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bambusoideae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Highly Useful</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">D.

It prefers light, well-draining soil that has been amended with well-composted materials. Start seedlings in peat pots, newspaper pots, or seed starting trays about seven weeks before the last frost in your area. Fill with sterile seed starting medium. Plant a few sweet basil seeds per cell or pot, and plant them one centimeter deep. Firm the soil well over the top. Warm, moist conditions should be maintained until germination. Germination should occur in about a week under ideal conditions. Several sets of true leaves should be enough to thin seedlings to just one per cell.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR PURPLE BASIL AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As leaves develop, move into a partially sunny spot. While germinating, the soil should be consistently moist but not soggy, as young plants may damp off and fail. As plants mature, they gradually move into a full sun location. When the seedlings have six true leaves, you should pinch off the top set. Strong, bushy plants will result. When your basil plants grow, you can pot them into increasingly larger containers. Bury the stems for solid plants. Please provide them with lots of light. For basil to thrive, full sun is needed. Let them grow and provide them with a warm environment. Basil cannot tolerate cold temperatures. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF PURPLE BASIL</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Like other types of basil, Purple basil contains Vitamin K, which helps with blood clotting and promotes bone health. A powerful antioxidant and antibacterial, basil oil boosts the immune system and combats aging and skin issues. This spice can be used to flavor beans, cheeses, chicken, eggs, fish, marinades, marrow, mushrooms, pasta, pasta sauces, and salads. In contrast to most herbs, this type of basil isn't green. The leaves are more significant than normal and are a bright purple color. There is a strong clove flavor, and it is not as sweet as other basil varieties.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #579e11;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Purple Basil Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 4-10</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 60 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Loamy</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">18° degrees Celsius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific Name:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Ocimum basilicum var. purpurascens</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Lamiales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Ocimum - Basils</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Ocimum </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Ocimum basilicum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Beneficial Herb</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

These vigorous vines require regular annual fertilization, which increases with size when established. Head the trained branches back to an upward-facing bud.

It would help to stratify strawberry seeds before planting them to make sure they will grow. You can do this by placing the strawberry seeds in an envelope or plastic bag and storing them in the fridge for a month. Since strawberry seeds need to be planted by February to prepare for harvest, start stratification in January. Sprouting certain seeds requires cold stratification. You simulate the conditions that seeds would encounter in nature during cold stratification. Once the seeds have been stratified, you should plant them half an inch deep into a container filled with sterile seed-starting mix. Gently press the seeds into the surface without covering them.</span></p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">RED STRAWBERRIES </span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Strawberry seeds require light to germinate. The seeds will germinate in one to six weeks. The seeds should be transplanted into larger pots six weeks after sprouting. You'll be able to plant your strawberry seedlings outdoors in another six weeks. You can harden off your strawberry seedlings by placing them in protected areas for half an hour at a time. Raise the amount of period the plants spend outside gradually. The seedlings should be transplanted into the garden once hardened off. Space them two feet apart and be sure to plant them in well-drained and acidic soil. Strawberries require full sun to grow. Make sure to give them at least one inch of water a week while they are in bloom. The strawberry plant doesn't have deep roots, so it doesn't require deep soil to grow.</span></p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">RED STRAWBERRIES  </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Strawberry can be added to smoothies, sorbets, pies, jello, and salads and incorporated into different recipes. Children love strawberries because of their flavor and colour; mothers love them because they allow them to experiment with different foods and make them look extra tasty. These potent little packages protect your heart, increase HDL (good) cholesterol, lower your blood pressure, and guard against cancer. As well as being rich in vitamins, fiber, and polyphenol antioxidants, strawberries are also sodium-free, fat-free, cholesterol-free, and low-calorie foods.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Red Strawberry Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zone: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">5-8</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Pot Growing Fruit</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fertile, Acidic Soil</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Harvest Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">4-6 Weeks</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Phytophthora fragariae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Higher classification:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Phytophthora</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Phylum: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Oomycota</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Peronosporaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">F. × ananassa</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Use:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Salad or Cake</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

It is imperative to keep cucumbers adequately watered because they are mostly water. Harvest cucumbers when they are relatively small. They will lose their flavor and quality if they grow too big.

      "description": "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>HOW TO GROW MORINGA OLEIFERA FROM SEEDS</b></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">As a tree, you should plant Moringa Seeds directly where the tree is to be grown and not transplant the seedling. Seedlings are fragile and rarely survive transplantation. For direct seed-planting, choose an area with light, sandy soil, not clayey or waterlogged. Dig holes 30 cm square and a foot deep. Place loose soil back into the holes. It is possible to grow trees in poor soil by adding compost or manure. Put three to five seeds in each hole spaced five centimetres apart. Plant the seeds no more profound than three times the seed's width. Ensure the soil is moist enough so that the topsoil will not dry and choke the emerging saplings, but not so wet that the seeds will drown and rot. </p>\n<h2><b>CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF MORINGA OLEIFERA</b></h2>\n<p>The healthiest sapling should be kept in the ground, and the rest should be removed as soon as they are four to six inches tall. Termites and nematodes can kill young saplings. Ensure that saplings are protected from these two dangers. The best location for growing moringa is one that receives direct sunlight for most of the day. Insufficient light can stunt plant growth. Water the soil regularly without allowing it to become wet. Plants of the Moringa family don't tolerate 'wet feet' and are sensitive to overwatering. Although moringa plants are drought-tolerant, young plants need consistent moisture to grow well. </p>\n<h2><b>MORINGA OLEIFERA USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</b></h2>\n<p>The Drumstick Tree, the miracle tree, the Ben oil tree, and the Horseradish Tree are all names for Moringa Oleifera. Horseradish has been used for centuries because of its medicinal properties and health benefits. It also has antifungal, antiviral, antidepressant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Also, it is taken by mouth to reduce swelling, as an antioxidant, prevent spasms, increase sex drive (as an aphrodisiac), boost the immune system, and increase milk production. It is sometimes used as a nutritional supplement or tonic.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><b><i>Note:</i></b></span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Specifications:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Product Type:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moringa oleifera </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>USDA Zone: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9-10</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Feature: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drought Tolerant</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Soil:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Slightly Acidic Soil</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Harvest Time: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 6-8 Months</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Kingdom: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Scientific name: </b><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moringa_oleifera\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moringa oleifera</span> </a>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Higher classification: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moringa</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Family: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moringaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Order: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brassicales</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Species: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M. oleifera</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Use:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nutritional Supplement</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

They can be planted directly in the garden after the last spring frost. You can use any organic potting soil that drains well or make a mixture with half garden soil and half compost. Make sure you have plenty of drainage holes in your pot because this plant dislikes moisture. A balanced fertilizer should be used regularly to feed potted specimens. Sow directly in March and April or in August and September</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<h2><strong><br>HOW TO CARE MARIGOLD CALENDULA PLANT</strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Keeping the soil moderately moist is the best way to grow calendula plants. If possible, let the container thoroughly dry before rewatering. It is unnecessary to fertilize compost-containing soil, but it can be augmented with phosphorus to encourage new blooms. Keep your plants in the partial shade instead of the full sun. Calendula prefers the cooler temperatures of spring and early fall to the heat of the summer. Calendula does not require any additional fertilizer or feeding. The best place to grow calendula is in vegetable gardens.</span></p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">BENEFITS OF </span></strong><strong>MARIGOLD </strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CALENDULA</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Pot marigold's common name refers to its use as a cooking herb in addition to its many health benefits.

In spring, sow the seeds 8 to 12 inches apart along a fence as soon as the ground is warm enough to work and all danger of frost has passed. Most gardeners in northern parts of the nation start seeds in pots indoors a few weeks before planting, then transplant them outdoors once the weather is warm and settled.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION  OF LOOFAH SQUASH</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Usually, Luffa vines grow to around 30 feet long and need a strong trellis. Therefore, if you plan to plant them, be prepared to give them sturdy support such as a fence or trellis. When your seedlings have hardened off, plant them in an area that receives full sun. Keep the Luffa watered during the summer. Every 4 to 6 weeks, feed your luffa plants with a diluted liquid fertilizer or compost tea.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">LOOFAH SQUASH USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p>When cooked, Luffa Gourd has a mild and slightly sweet taste. Similar to summer squash or zucchini. Long-term cooking of Luffa causes the flesh to break out due to its delicate texture. Luffa is taken by mouth for treating and preventing colds. Nasal swelling and sinus problems can also be treated with it. It is also used to treat muscle and joint pain. And to used restore menstrual cycles in women.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong> Product:</strong> Luffa Gourd, Loofah Squash Seeds<br><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sowing depth: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">2 cm deep</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Slightly Acidic</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hardiness Zones: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">6 Above</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloom Time:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 90-120 Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Rosids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Cucurbitales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Cucurbitaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subfamily:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Cucurbitoideae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tribe:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Sicyoeae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Luffa</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Beneficial Veggy</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Information:</span></strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ireland u0026amp; Northern Ireland:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Orders placed before 4 p.m. will be delivered the next day, otherwise usually two working days. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> From 2,00 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rest of the World :</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-11 Working Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From 2,90 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">- Except</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> for Australia u0026amp; New Zealand, shipping costs are from 3.50 Euros.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at<span> </span></span><b>Garden Paradise Seeds</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are dedicated to providing the best quality products with the best customer service in the entire market.

You will receive healthy seeds from Garden Paradise Seeds. For most satisfactory results, soak them in warm water overnight and plant them 1 to 2 inches deep in a sterile seed-starting mix. Keeping the mix moist should ensure germination within two weeks or a month. When moving an outdoor tree, make sure it has been outdoors for at least six months. Soursop seedlings should be planted in full to partial sun and well-drained, slightly acidic soil protected from strong winds. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF SOURSOP</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Seedlings should be planted about twenty feet away from buildings or other plantings and heavily mulched with compost to keep the soil moist since the roots are shallow. Choose soursop grafted onto pond apple if your site is subject to flooding since soursop cannot tolerate standing water. After the tree's trunk diameter reaches two to four inches, you can prune it back to 30 inches tall. As the central leader, choose the most vertical shoot, and three or four other shoots are evenly spaced around the trunk to serve as branches.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SOURSOP USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The guanabana is best eaten raw after cutting it in half and scooping out the flesh with a spoon (you'll need to work around the seeds or spit them out as you go). Because of its stringy texture, soursop will be challenging to cut up into cubes, hence the requirement to scoop it out with a spoon. Soursop fruit and Graviola leaves are used in herbal medicine as a sedative to treat specific ailments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product type: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soursop Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zone: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">9-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tasty Fruits</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fertile, Moist, Full Sunny Spot</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Harvest Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">3-5 Years</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Annona muricata</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Higher classification: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Annona</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Magnoliids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Magnoliales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Annonaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Annona</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> A. muricata</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Sunflowers require heavy feeding so that the wealthiest blooms can be found on fertilized soils. Ideally, seeds should be planted 15 cm apart in a shallow trench of 2.5 to 5 cm depth, between 2.5 and 5cm deep. Cover the seeds and keep them watered until the seeds sprout. It may sprout in 7 to 10 days. During the first half-meter after the first true leaves appear, thin plants are separated by about half a meter. Sowing should be done between March and May.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SUNFLOWER</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is easy to grow sunflowers since they are heat-tolerant. As a fast-growing plant, sunflowers also resist pests. Plants that have been established need deep, infrequent watering to encourage deep-root development. If your sunflowers like heat, water one or two gallons of water per plant once a week. When the weather is extremely dry or hot, use more water. Sunflower plants may need to be supported when they bloom to not fall over.

Plant the seeds in a small container with a very thin layer of soil. Plants buried too deeply in the ground won't sprout readily. Place the container in a warm, humid environment after planting the Table Palm seed. Window boxes in steamy bathrooms would be a great fit. Place the container in a warm location, like a window sill or the top of your refrigerator, if you will not use a plastic bag. The young plants can be transplanted outside in their first summer after sprouting over the winter or in early spring. The seeds will germinate once they are planted. </span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">LIVISTONA ROTUNDIFOLIA</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Serdang Palm or many species of Palm will thrive in dappled sunlight. It isn't recommended to transplant young tree palms until they have three or four leaves, as many species of Palm are susceptible to root shock upon transplantation. So, seedlings of palms should be started in larger pots. The rate of growth for a palm seedling varies with species. Plants grown in partial shade when they are young and in full sun when they are mature do best. If the soil feels dry to the touch in the morning, you may need to water it. Avoid waterlogging conditions. Early monsoons and springtime are the best times to apply organic fertilizer.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THE SERDANG PALM TREE?</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are several advantages of Serdang Palm. Absorbs pollutants, including acetone, xylene, and toluene, that are found in indoor air. A significant advantage is that some farmers don't have to spend much money making buildings because their leaves and branches are used to make roofs and other materials. Additionally, the fruits of this tree are used as vegetables and for sweets.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>\n<strong> Product: </strong>Livistona Rotundifolia Seeds<br><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Any</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Common Name:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Table palm, Umbrella Palm, Round Leaf Fan Palm, Serdang</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Maximum height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 12 m</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Flower Colour:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Yellow</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloom Time:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Difficulty Level:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Easy to medium</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific Name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Livistona Rotundifolia</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Specific:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Clay</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Use:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Decor</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-7 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

In the spring, the seeds are planted relatively early. Make sure that the seeds are soaked in water for a day or two in advance to have the best chance of germinating. Approximately 30cm apart, sow asparagus seed thinly in rows of 2 to 5cm depth. Maintain a moist seedbed by regularly watering them. You can thin Purple Asparagus seedlings approximately 5cm apart once the seedlings are large enough after waiting a few weeks.<br><br></span></div>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF PURPLE ASPARAGUS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Full sun is very conducive to the growth of Pacific Asparagus. So tall plants don't shade your garden during the summer; place them on the west or north-facing slope. Set the distance between 30 and 50 cm. Almost all asparagus varieties require nutrient-rich, well-drained soil to grow successfully. About three years are needed for Purple Asparagus to reach total productivity. Be patient so that you can achieve your goal. Before harvesting a one-year-old crown, it must be grown for two years. In other words, it's easy, but you have to be patient with it. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HEALTH BENEFITS OF PURPLE ASPARAGUS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Health benefits of Pacific purple asparagus abound. Anthocyanins are the pigments contained in them. In addition to giving this vegetable its color, these pigments also act as antioxidants. Asparagus can also help to reduce blood pressure and the risk of heart attacks and heart disease. In addition to lowering liver toxins, purple asparagus increases liver enzymes, which boosts liver function.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">:</span></em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product type: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asparagu</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">s</span></em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 60 cm - 2m</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Spread</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 60cm - 1m</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Growth</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rate</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Fast </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Water</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Needs</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Moderate</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Monocots </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Asparagales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asparagaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subfamily: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asparagoideae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Asparagus </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> A.

Dig a hole in your Papaya tree, fill it with good compost and soil, then fill it with nutritious soil. Now you can sprinkle on some seeds which you will receive from us. Per bed, about a dozen is a good amount. We suggest using even more. Seeds of F1 Hybrid Papaya 720 should be covered lightly with compost before being mulched.  </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF RED PAPAYA</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is essential to take more care of the F1 Hybrid Papaya 720. Papaya trees require a lot of water in warm weather, but overwatering in cold weather is the leading cause of problems. Papayas need a lot of fertilizing, so they fertilize them regularly. Heat and sunlight are ideal for hybrid papaya 720. Both partial shade and full sun can be used to grow them. For fertilization, you can use something like chicken manure or a complete fertilizer. Papayas handle solid or fresh manures fairly well. Don't forget to compost generously as well. In warm weather, papayas evaporate a lot of water due to their large leaves.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HEALTH BENEFITS OF RED TAIWAN PAPAYA</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hybrid F1 papayas are considered to be superfruits.

Sow seeds approximately 1-2cm deep in moist, well-drained potting soil. Most standard soil mixes are suitable for pepper seeds. Maintain a warm soil temperature to ensure a successful planting. Keep soil moderately moist, though not overly dripping wet. Soil should be watered when it just begins to dry. Padron Pepper needs regular watering, but Padron Pepper should not overwater it. </span></div>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><br>CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF PIMIENTOS'DE PADRON PEPPER</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It would be best if you waited until a few leaves appeared on the Padron Pepper seedlings after they sprout. Place the plants in their holes after the tiny plants are taken out. Padron Pepper should backfill the holes with topsoil. During a cloudy or early evening period, transplant the seedlings to give them time to adapt to the new environment before the sun brings full force to the plants. It is good to thin plants to 80cm to 1m and rows to 2-3m. In warm climates, place peppers in full sun, but make sure they have access to shade in summer. For best results, keep the plants well hydrated.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PIMIENTOS'DE PADRON PEPPER AND ITS BENEFITS </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Several health benefits are associated with Padron Pepper. In addition to providing excellent nutritional value, these are good sources of fiber that help improve digestion.

This will help the seeds to germinate more quickly. Fill a seed tray or a pot with a well-draining potting mix that contains perlite, vermiculite, or sand to promote drainage. Plant the seeds about 1/2 inch deep into the potting mix and cover them with a thin layer of soil. </span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Water the soil until it is moist but not soaking wet. Place the pot or seed tray in a warm, bright location that receives indirect sunlight. Wait for the seeds to germinate, which should take around 10 to 20 days. Once the seedlings have developed two sets of true leaves, transplant them into larger pots or containers with nutrient-rich soil. </span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">CARE FOR JACARANDA AFTER GERMINATION </b></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jacaranda trees need regular watering, especially during the hot and dry summer months. Keep the soil moist, but avoid overwatering as this can cause root rot. Water the tree deeply once a week, and more frequently if the weather is arid. Jacaranda trees benefit from regular fertilization during the growing season. </span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer that contains equal amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. </span><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trees do not require heavy pruning, but light pruning can help to shape the tree and remove any dead or diseased branches.

When in full bloom, the tree creates a stunning canopy of color that can be enjoyed by all. They have a wide, spreading canopy that can provide shade and shelter from the sun's harsh rays during the hot summer months. This can make it a great addition to outdoor spaces such as gardens, patios, or parks. Jacaranda trees can provide a habitat for birds, bees, and other wildlife. The tree's flowers are a rich source of nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its dense foliage can provide shelter for birds and other small animals.</span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Specifications:</b></p>\n<ul data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name: Jacaranda tree, black poui</span></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Botanical Name: Jacaranda mimosifoila</span></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family: Bignoniaceae</span></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plant Type: Flowering tree</span></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mature Size: 25–50 ft. tall, 15–30 ft. wide</span></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloom Time: Spring, summer</span></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hardiness Zones: 10 and 11 (USDA)</span></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Native Area: South America</span></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sun Exposure: Full</span></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soil Type: Sandy, well-drained</span></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soil pH: Neutral to acidic</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

The seeds should be covered with soil by one to two centimeters. Cover the seeds with firm soil. Don't let the soil dry out. Germination occurs at a soil temperature of 24 degrees celsius. It will take about six to ten days for the seeds to germinate. Seeds must be exposed to at least fifteen hours of light per day once they have sprouted. Once the plants have reached five inches, transplant them into peat pots of six cm. Placing the root ball at the bottom of the pot and filling it with soil will ensure better root growth along the stem. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR GIANT TOMATO AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Wait until night temperatures are warm before transplanting. While the fruits are developing, profoundly and regularly water them. It is recommended to give your plants at least one inch of water per week, but they may need more during hot, dry spells. You should give your plants a drink if they appear wilted for most of the day. Watering can be reduced when the fruit begins to ripen. Taking away the water will encourage the plant to concentrate its sugars, resulting in a better flavor. You must not withhold water so much that the plants often wilt and feels stressed, or they will rapidly their blossoms and possibly their fruit.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF GIANT TOMATO</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The giant tomato is suitable for both raw and cooked applications. Fresh salsa makes good use of their sweet and tangy flavor, and their large size makes them perfect for slices and salads. Sautéed, roasted, smoked, breaded and fried, pickled, or cooked into sauces can also be prepared in these ways. Nutritional tomato products may improve heart health, support bone, skin, and eye health, and have anti-inflammatory effects. Some people may experience acid reflux, joint pain, autoimmune diseases, or allergic reactions due to using these products.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #00bc60;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #00bc60;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Giant Tomato Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">9</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 80 Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Loamy</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">20-25° Degrees C</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Solanum Lycopersicum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Solanaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rank: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cultivar</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Solanum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Beneficial Vegetable</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

The seeds should be planted thickly and later thinned to a half-inch spacing. Once the plants reach five inches in height, they should be clipped. Good drainage and loose soil are essential. It is best to use sandy soil. Raised beds work well. Compacted, hard soil will prevent the bulb's growth. If necessary, add about an inch and a half of peat moss, compost, or other organic matter. The type of fertilizer you should use can be determined by testing your soil. It needs a lot of space. If the bulbs are too close together, they will not grow properly. Rows should be spaced 12 to 18 inches apart, 4 to 6 inches between plants. They can be planted in two rows or multiple rows per bed.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR GIANT ONION AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Full sun is required for the giant onions. Usually planted outside in late April, onions tolerate light frost. They require irrigation for giant bulbs. The roots of onions are shallow, making them vulnerable to drought. Rainfall or irrigation should provide one inch of water every week to the plant. During bulb growth, the availability of water is crucial. During this stage, some gardeners water 1.5 inches every week. Weeds compete for water, nutrients, and sunlight, so you have to control them. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF GIANT ONION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Commonly known as the giant onion, Allium giganteum is a species native to mid and southwestern Asia but cultivated in many countries as a garden plant. Growing to 1.5 meters, it is the tallest species of Allium in common cultivation. Leaves, bulbs, and bulblets are edible. Collect leaves during spring and fall. When the bulbs are large enough, you can use them like cultivated onions in the second year.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Note:</span></em></strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Giant Onion Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spring</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span></strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 4-9</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 50-125 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Acidic, neutral, alkaline</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">20° to 25°C</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Allium giganteum</span>\n</li>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: Plantae</span></strong></li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Monocots</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asparagales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Amaryllidaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subfamily: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Allioideae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Allium</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A. giganteum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Beneficial Vegetable</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Seeds should be planted in pots in a greenhouse, hoop house, or cold frame once the ground has warmed up. That way, you can begin sowing three to four weeks before your last frost date and enjoy a head start on outdoor-sown corn. Sow eight to ten seeds 1cm deep into 10cm wide pots. Seed-starting potting mixes or general-purpose potting mixes will work fine. The seeds can also be sown into smaller pots or plug trays, germination two seeds per pot or plug, and weaker seedlings should be removed.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF SWEETCORN</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Carefully tear apart the roots of the young plants after you have removed them from their pots. Keep the soil around the roots intact as much as possible. Now plant your sweet corn 45cm apart in both directions. For each plant, dig a hole, place the seeds in the hole, and then firm the soil back down. Sweet corn hates the cold. Keep pots moist as they grow on. Using your hands, remove any weeds that grow within your sweetcorn and continue the wedding while you can still reach between the plants. Sweetcorn is sturdy and shouldn’t need support. As the silks appear and the cobs start to form in late summer, they will benefit from watering during arid weather.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SWEETCORN USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Especially for its versatility, sweet corn has been a staple food for centuries. You can utilize it topping for soups, salads, and pizzas. Cornmeal, polenta, cornmeal, and syrup can all be made with it directly off the cob. Vitamin C, abundant in corn, protects your cells from damage and helps prevent diseases such as cancer and heart disease.

Sow them directly into the ground 1cm deep. Cold stratification means breaking a seed’s dormancy to allow the seed to germinate in 15 to 30 days. You can start Tansy seeds indoors as early as eight weeks before the last frost if you are planting them in the spring. Planting tansy plants in the fall is also possible, but it is usually done by dividing established plants and planting the divisions, not growing them from seeds. Therefore, you have the choice of when to plant the seeds. Our recommendation, however, is to sow in spring and eight to nine weeks before the last frost.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<br><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></span>\n</div>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF TANSY SEEDS</span></strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">While growing Tansy, you have to take care of it. Tansy seedlings should be thinned to 16 cm apart once they reach the seedling stage. Depending on the shade or the amount of sun, tansy plants can grow either way. The plant prefers fertile, well-drained soils and areas with minimal vegetation. It has even been used internally to kill parasites in humans and animals in the past as a companion plant as it repels pests—the flowers of the Tansy last a long time. Tansy grows well as a border or edging. Tansy plants do not require a lot of effort once established. So you don’t need to worry about caring for the plants.</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">BENEFITS OF HERB TANSY</span></strong></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Fern-like aromatic leaves and yellow button-like flower heads.

It would help if you did not use a potting mix that contains fertilizer because the fertilizer's chemicals will burn the plants and their roots. Seed-starting mixes can be purchased from professional growers or made at home by combining peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite. Ensure the excess water runs out of the drainage holes by thoroughly watering the medium. Mix peppermint seeds lightly into the mix and scatter them on the surface. It's best not to cover seedlings with the mixture as they germinate best when exposed to light. Mist the growing medium every day to keep it moist. Typically, seedlings grow in 10 to 16 days. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF PEPPERMINT</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Make sure to thin and transplant when the seedlings are 2 inches high. Begin seeds indoors before the last frost, and plant outdoors only afterward. Aim for a distance of 12 to 20 inches between plants. Remove all weeds and loosen the soil by placing it in a location that receives some shade in the afternoon. Containers on decks and patios look great with Peppermint. It would help if you used a large container to give the plant room to spread. Cut any trailing stems that touch the ground below the pot to prevent it from growing roots where it touches the ground.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HEALTH BENEFITS OF PEPPERMINT</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Peppermint includes a lot of health benefits as a herb. Various digestive symptoms can be improved by applying peppermint oil to muscles in your digestive system. The same can be said for peppermint tea. Researchers suggest that peppermint oil reduces migraines and tension headaches. Peppermint tea may enhance headache symptoms. Peppermint oil has been shown to kill the germs that cause bad breath. Peppermint tea is also an effective breath freshener because it contains peppermint oil.

Once the seedlings have developed two sets of true leaves, transplant them into larger pots or containers with nutrient-rich soil.</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">CARE FOR BLUE SAUSAGE FRUIT TREE AFTER GERMINATION </b></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blue Sausage Fruit Trees need regular watering, especially during the hot and dry summer months. Keep the soil moist, but avoid overwatering as this can cause root rot. Use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer that contains equal amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. They are sensitive to frost and cold temperatures and may suffer damage if exposed to prolonged periods of cold. Move them indoors during the winter months. The trees require full sunlight to thrive, so make sure to plant them in a location where they will receive at least six hours of direct sunlight each day. Watch out for pests such as aphids, mealybugs, and spider mites. Treat them with neem oil or insecticidal soap</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">BENEFITS OF HAVING A BLUE SAUSAGE FRUIT TREE</b></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fruit is shaped like a sausage and has a blue or purple color when mature, making it a great conversation piece and a unique addition to any fruit collection.

Place the seeds in a shallow container of water. Put your seeds in the ground next, as this begins the germination process and increases your chances of success. Make certain that the temperature does not get too hot by using a food thermometer. If you do not have a container handy, you can also place the seeds in a bag and fill it with water, plant one seed in the center of each peat pellet. Make a small hole at the top of each shot with a wooden skewer. Insert a seed into the center of each shell. You should be able to fully cover the pellet with peat by pressing it down with your finger.</span></div>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></strong></h2>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR GIANT BAMBOO AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ensure the greenhouse receives more than ten hours of indirect sunlight each day.

Make a hole in the potting soil specifically designed for plants in open-soil gardens and plant the plant there.

It prefers slightly acidic soil with a pH between six and seven. If you want the best results, place the plants in full sun for at least six hours every day. Arugula will also grow in partial shade. As pests and diseases may persist in areas where arugula has recently been planted, it is best to avoid planting it there. Approximately an inch apart, plant 1 cm deep in rows ten inches apart. Alternatively, mix arugula seeds with other salad greens or broadcast arugula seeds alone. Arugula seeds will germinate in soil temperatures as low as 4°C.</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF ROCKET ARUGULA</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Make sure the soil is evenly moist in warm weather to prevent bolting. As your plants grow, thin them out to avoid overcrowding and disease. Leaves should be picked in the evening to not wilt in the hot sun. Arugula is a great companion plant! It is accessible to seed around many slower-growing crops because it has shallow roots and doesn't take much space. You may also want to find strains that are heat-resistant if you're growing in summer. Wild arugula is more heat tolerant. It matures a bit slower, taking about five weeks to grow, so remember that if you're planting for a continual harvest.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">ROCKET ARUGULA USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Raw arugula is often served in salads. Pepper pairs nicely with other strong flavors, such as salty cheeses, citrus, and more. It's also used to top cooked pizzas or whirled into pesto. As a mild side dish or addition to soups, pasta, and other dishes, the greens can also be sautéed. One cup of arugula a day will provide your body with 100 percent of the vitamin K it needs. Arugula contains eight times more calcium than iceberg lettuce. There is evidence that it contains indole-3-carbinol and isothiocyanates, which suppress inflammation in the body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product type: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rocket Arugula Seed</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zone: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">3-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fast Growing</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fertile, Moist</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Harvest Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">30-40 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Eruca sativa</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Higher classification: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Eruca</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Brassicaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">E. vesicaria</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Brassicales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Beneficial Herb</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Water will penetrate the seed shell and cause the embryos inside to plump up. Seeds should then be planted in moist soil. You can start seeds indoors in spring by soaking them and placing them in a sandwich bag halfway filled with wet, seed-starting medium, followed by another inch of starter medium applied on top of the seeds. Keep the bag in the refrigerator. Seeds should be transplanted into pots after sprouting roots. Seedlings should be placed in a sheltered nursery area once they germinate. </span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">OSMANTHUS </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">FRAGANS</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plant the Sweet Osmanthus plants 120 to 150 cm apart to form a hedge or screen. A sweet osmanthus flower should be grown in full sunlight or partial shade with well-drained soil. Once established, plants are relatively drought-tolerant but will perform their best with ample moisture. When the Osmanthus shrub is recently planted, it needs to be watered regularly until it is established and grows. Then you only need to rinse it during periods of prolonged drought. During the fall, fertilize your garden with a general-purpose fertilizer. It's now just a matter of waiting.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">THE BENEFITS OF SWEET OSMANTHUS</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Almost any type of tea goes well with sweet Osmanthus. You can try it with white, green, black, oolong tea, and even tisanes like mint. As a result of the antioxidants found in osmanthus flowers, your body can remove most toxins. Osmanthus sweet is excellent for skincare. Known as a skin tone enhancer and skin revitalizer, osmanthus tea can help rejuvenate your complexion.  </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #0d9709;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Osmanthus fragrans flower </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 15 to 30 feet</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Leaf arrangement:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> opposite </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Flower color</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: white/yellow</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fruit shape</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: round</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Lamiales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Oleaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Osmanthus </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">O. fragrans</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br>Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br>Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

The seeds can be started indoors if you're looking for bigger plants and quicker blooms. Because they are large seeds, we suggest starting with a relatively large, 15cm or 10 cm seed starting pot. Each pot should have two seeds diameter of 2.5 cm and should be placed under lights or in a sunny location, such as a south-facing window. It takes about 10 to 12 days for nasturtiums to germinate. Prune out the weaker seedling, leaving just one per pot, when the seedlings have several sets of leaves. The next step is to know what to do once the seeds have germinated.<br></span></div>\n<div><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><br></span><strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </span></strong></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">NASTURTIUM</span></strong><br>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In dry weather, it's essential to keep Nasturtiums hydrated since they are relatively carefree and easy to grow. They do well in containers and window boxes. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. To keep these plants blooming throughout the summer, use liquid fertilizer regularly. The top edge of the pot must be buried to prevent soil moisture from wicking away from the seedling. Nasturtium perennials can reach a height of up to three meters.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">THE BENEFITS OF NASTURTIUM</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Like watercress, Nasturtium flowers are edible and taste peppery. In salads or as a garnish, any color and variety are delicious. Leaves can be eaten, too. The leaves and flowers are edible and taste like garden cress. Nasturtium petals and leaves are both packed with nutrients, containing high levels of vitamin C. It can improve the immune system, tackling sore throats, coughs, and colds, as well as bacterial and fungal infections.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\">Note</span>:</span></em></strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong> Product:</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> Nasturtium Seeds, Tropaeolum Majus</span><br><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sowing Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">15-30 cm</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 35-52 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloom Time:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> May to September</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Zone:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 2 to 11 (annual)</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Benefits:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">  urinary tract infections (UTIs), swollen airways, cough, and bronchitis</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">More:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Reproductive</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Rosids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Brassicales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tropaeolaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tropaeolum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">T. majus</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Sage will tolerate partial shade, but the flavor of its leaves will be diminished. Soil with good drainage is ideal for growing sage. The best soil is sandy loam, but sage will also grow in average soil. The pH of the soil should be between 6.0 and 6.7 for Sage to thrive. You can start Sage seeds indoors 6 or 8 weeks in advance of the average last frost date. In late spring and about a month after last frost, plant sage seeds in the garden. Seeds should be sown shallowly. The seeds of sage should be planted 1 cm deep. Thin seedlings of sage or space transplants are at least 50cm apart. Aim for a distance of 50 to 70 cm between rows. After the last frost, plant seedlings into the garden when the ground has thawed.<br><br></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HERB SAGE</span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Until sage is established, water it regularly. As soon as you have established the sage, keep it dry. Keeping the soil moist will help to prevent sage from being killed. While sage will benefit from a lack of water, it should not become wilted because of a lack of moisture. A serious mildew problem may result from overhead watering. A sandy-loam soil is best for growing sage, but it does not need to be fertilized. The second time in the growing season, sprinkle the sage with compost tea. You can mulch Sage with compost or chopped leaves in very hot regions. This will slow soil evaporation and prevent weeds from growing.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">WHAT IS SAGE?, A LOT TO KNOW!</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In some varieties, sages can grow taller and more comprehensive than 50 cm, although a few types grow to a taller height. In late spring, the flower spikes of sage grow upright. Sage produces tubular flowers that usually appear in whorls on tall spikes and are red, bluish-lavender, or bicolor. Summer is the best time of year to see sage flowers. It has elongated, oval-to-lance-shaped, wrinkled, grayish-green leaves that range in length from 5 to 10cm with a coarse, pebbly surface. Salvia varieties come with variegated leaves like purple, yellow, green, and green and white.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong> Product: </strong>Sage Spanish Seeds<br><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sowing Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 60cm</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 12-24 Months</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloom Time:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 15-degrees c</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Use:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">  dyspepsia, skin</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">More:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Reproductive</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Lamiales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lamiaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Salvia</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">S.

Loose soil and well-draining are ideal for growing oregano. Oregano prefers a soil pH of 6.0 to 7.0. In well-drained soil, oregano can grow. Start sowing oregano indoors at least four weeks before the average last frost date. The best germination rate of oregano seed is reached at 70°F; sowing the seed at this temperature will maximize growth. Germination happens quickly when seeds are in the light and covered with cheesecloth. Transplant seedlings out after the last frost. Plant oregano seeds in your garden at the end of spring, when the last frost usually occurs. Temperatures should be at least 45°F in the soil.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF GREEK OREGANO</span></strong><br>\n</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\">Water is essential for Oregano Plants. As it grows, give the oregano regular, even watering. The new plant will benefit from only occasional watering once established. Moist soil will cause oregano to be less flavorful. You can spray oregano 2 to 3 times with compost tea or liquid seaweed extract during the growing season. Keep oregano roots cool by mulching them with old compost during hot weather. Keep oregano pinched back to induce bushy growth and for the best aroma and flavor; flowering will result in a loss of leaf flavor. The summer is a great time to prune your plants nearly to the ground, stimulating new growth. Replant clumps every three years, dividing every three years.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">WHAT IS GREEK OREGANO AND ITS BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Greek oregano, scientifically known as Origanum vulgare, is a herb valued for its distinct flavor profile.

It is easiest to plant the seeds in small pots filled with damp, loamy soil because they are very fine. August to September are the best months to sow. To settle the seeds into the soil, sprinkle a few seeds into the pot and tap the bottom of the pot on the counter. You may need to spray water onto the feverfew seed to prevent the seeds from drying out. Poured water may cause the seeds to move. In about two weeks, feverfew seeds should germinate in a sunny window or under a grow light. Approximately when the plants reach 7.5 cm. Once the roots have taken hold, plant them in a bright spot in your garden. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION</span> OF HERB FEVERFEW</strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The only requirement for growing feverfew somewhere other than an herb garden is that the spot is sunny. Pollinators are not needed to pollinate feverfew, which can self-pollinate. It should be planted in a place that gets full sun or a bit of light shade. Plants grow best in sandy or loamy soil with pH levels between 6.0 and 6.7. According to climate, feverfew is either a biennial or a short-lived perennial. The seeds will bloom in their first year when they are started early.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SOME TIPS FOR FEVERFEW </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Medicinal purposes include the treatment of rheumatism and migraines using feverfew leaves. There are ornamental daisy-like flowers on it—approximately 60 centimeters high. The plant grows perennially, so cut it back just after the frost and let it regrow in the spring. The plant re-seeds pretty quickly, so you are likely to be giving away new plants within two years. During the summer and autumn, the feverfew herb blooms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sowing Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 5 - 9</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sunlight: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Needed</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mature Spread:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 50cm</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloom Time:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> July-October</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">More:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Reproductive</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asteroids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Asterales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asteraceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tanacetum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanacetum_parthenium\">Tanacetum parthenium</a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span></strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Information:</span></strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ireland u0026amp; Northern Ireland:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Orders placed before 4 p.m. will be delivered the next day, otherwise usually two working days. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> From 2,00 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rest of the World :</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-11 Working Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From 2,90 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">- Except</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> for Australia u0026amp; New Zealand, shipping costs are from 3.50 Euros.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at<span> </span></span><b>Garden Paradise Seeds</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are dedicated to providing the best quality products with the best customer service in the entire market.

Transplant the seedlings outdoors after about eight weeks from the time you sow the seed indoors. When the last frost has passed, you can plant the seed in biodegradable pots to be set out in the garden in spring. A temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal for optimal germination. Plants that are transplanted or moved do not like the taproot of anise. The anise plant grows best in well-draining, organic-rich soil; however, it can also grow in poor soil. Anise prefers soil pH levels between 6.0 and 6.7. In dry conditions, anise does well, but in very wet soil, it will not survive.</span>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">ANISE</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you are taking good care of it, anise can grow very quickly. The ground starts to dry out when the water evaporates. Overwatering anise will cause it to die. Plants should be side-dressed with aged compost or all-purpose organic fertilizer at midseason. The stems of anise are weak. Plants that become leggy need to be staked, as do plants in ornamental gardens. You can grow anise indoors in winter. If possible, place plants under fluorescent lights or near a window. In a container, anise grows quickly. Make sure your container is at least eight inches deep and wide. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">KNOW ABOUT THIS HERB ANISE</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Anise has numerous health benefits as an herb. As well as treating menstrual discomfort or pain, easing childbirth, and enhancing sexual drive, women use anise to increase milk flow when nursing. Men use anise to treat male menopause symptoms. Other uses include treating seizures, smoking addiction, insomnia, asthma, and constipation. This herb can help you deal with all of these problems if you have its power.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\">Note</span>:</span></em></strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Product: </strong>Anise Seeds</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 4-9</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 100 days.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 2 feet</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Well-drained soil</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 15 degrees Celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Use:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">   Nutrients, Depression, Stomach Ulcers</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">More:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Reproductive</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Apiales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Apiaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Pimpinella</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">P. anisum</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Information:</span></strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ireland u0026amp; Northern Ireland:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Orders placed before 4 p.m. will be delivered the next day, otherwise usually two working days. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> From 2,00 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rest of the World :</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-11 Working Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From 2,90 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">- Except</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> for Australia u0026amp; New Zealand, shipping costs are from 3.50 Euros.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at<span> </span></span><b>Garden Paradise Seeds</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are dedicated to providing the best quality products with the best customer service in the entire market.

Take them home and soak them in a small amount of distilled water for up to 24 hours. Many seeds need a period of cold, moist conditions to germinate. Seeds sit in the ground over the winter to achieve this in nature. By stratifying seeds, you can mimic these conditions. Plant the seeds in pots filled with good soil in early spring after being removed from the refrigerator. Plant seeds individually in small pots, or plant them in larger pots that are at least an inch deep.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR GRPAEVINES AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After your seedlings have grown to about 8 cm, transplant them into 10 cm pots. To grow the healthiest plants, grow seedlings inside or in a greenhouse until the plants are 25 cm tall, have a good root system, and have at least five leaves. Grapevines require the right amount of sun, proper drainage, and a means of support to thrive. Ensure that the location is sunny. A grapevine needs 7-8 hours of direct sunlight per day. Provide enough space. It is recommended that you space your plants about 2.5 m apart to allow for growth.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF GRAPES</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A good source of potassium is grapes, a mineral that helps balance fluids in your body. Your risk of heart disease and stroke can be lowered by consuming potassium. Grapes are a good source of this nutrient, which is in short supply among most people. Grapes contain compounds that may prevent high cholesterol levels by decreasing cholesterol absorption. In an eight-week study, three cups of red grapes per day lowered total and LDL (harmful) cholesterol levels in 69 people with high cholesterol.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #01b123;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Grape Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 4-10</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Maturity</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Up to 3 Years</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Well Drained Soil</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">25° - 30° degrees Celsius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Vitis</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Higher classification: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Grapes</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Vitales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rank: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Vitaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subfamily: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Vitoideae</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Plant a few seeds in a smallish pot after filling it with seed compost and firming it lightly. Most seeds that you will receive from us will germinate, so only sow a few more than you need in case of losses. Put a plant label on top of the vermiculite and water the bed. Put the pots on a sunny windowsill or in a heated propagator at 21°C. Seeds will germinate quickly. Set a clear plastic bag over each pot to raise the humidity, secured with an elastic band. Whenever seedlings begin to appear, remove the pot or the plastic bag from the propagator. Keep in good light and water regularly.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR CHILI PEPPER AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Seedlings of Jalapeno should be transplanted into individual pots filled with multipurpose compost once they are 2.5 cm tall. Such plants are beneficial where growing conditions are excellent. Once the roots appear through the drainage holes in the pot's base, move the plants into larger 13cm pots when they are still growing indoors.

It is best to sow seeds around the end of March, during the spring season. There will be a lot of rain in the spring, which will help water the tiny plants, and the sun will shine enough in the daytime to provide enough light for the tree. Poke a hole around 2 to 4 cm in diameter and place your seed inside. Fill the hole around the seed once it's in place. Make sure not to compact the soil after you fill the hole. Keep it loose—water every two to three days.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF GUAVE </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When the tiny plants have a few leaves, transplant them. Don't forget to ensure that the area receives at least 6 to 8 hours of sun each day. Also, make sure the spot is in open space, so the top of your tree doesn't collide with anything. In the early stages of the tree's life, you should water it 2 to 3 times each week. Nevertheless, it will need less water once it becomes mature, so you only need to water it 2 to 3 times per month. Fertilize the tree once every three months with organic fertilizer. This step should only be performed until your tree is well established.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HEALTH BENEFITS OF GUAVA</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Guava is healthful in many ways. Guavas provide a high amount of dietary fiber, which aids healthy bowel movements and prevents constipation. The fiber content of one Guava provides you with twelve percent of the daily recommended fiber intake. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Guava helps,</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Benefit Your Digestive System</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Aid Weight Loss</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Have an Anticancer Effect</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">May Help Boost Your Immunity</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Good for Your Skin</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lower Blood Sugar Levels</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Boost Heart Health</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Relieve Symptoms of Menstruation</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Note:</span></em></strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Guave Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Specific: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Well Drained</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Style: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Perennial</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">50 cm - 1 m</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Aging period: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">12-24 Months</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Place Of Origin: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Taiwan</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature:  </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Health Benefits, Due to the presence of Vitamin A</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses:  </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Improves Eyesight</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">More:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Reproductive</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Rosids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Myrtales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Myrtaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Psidium</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> P. guajava</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-7 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At <strong>Garden</strong></span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

As soon as the pepper seeds sprout, carefully plant them in individual containers such as pea pots. Cover the seedlings with a fine dusting of compost after seeding them into a free-draining compost. In a propagator, place seeds at 25-30 degrees Celsius until they germinate, which takes 10 to 15 days.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">KNOW ABOUT THIS PEPPER </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">APACHE</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Apache Pepper is an extremely popular, reliable, and non-spreading type of hot pepper. It grows to a height of 35-45 cm. In abundance, small conical-shaped fruits mature from light green to a glossy red color maturing from 70,000 - 80,000 Scovilles. Apaches are very useful in the kitchen as an everyday type of chili with a medium heat level. If you don't want to use them fresh, you can freeze them and use them later, frozen or dried and ground into chili powder/flakes. </span></p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">INSTRUCTION FOR GROWING HOT PEPPER </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">APACHE </span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plant hot pepper seedlings into three pots when they are large enough to handle.

Once the ground has warmed up, it is safest to plant the seeds in pots in a greenhouse, hoop house, or cold frame. That way, you can begin sowing three to four weeks before your last frost date and enjoy a head start on outdoor-sown corn. Sow eight to ten seeds 1cm deep into 10cm wide pots. Seed-starting potting mixes or general-purpose potting mixes will work fine. Alternatively, sow into smaller pots or plug trays, sowing two seeds to each pot or module and removing the weaker seedling.<br><br></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span><br>\n</div>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF SWEETCORN</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After you have removed your young plants from their pots, carefully tease their roots apart. Make sure you retain as much soil as possible around the roots. Now plant your sweet corn 45cm apart in both directions. For each plant, dig a hole, place the seeds in the hole, and then firm the soil back down. Sweet corn hates the cold. Keep pots moist as they grow on. Using your hands, remove any weeds that grow within your sweetcorn and continue the wedding while you can still reach between the plants. Sweetcorn is sturdy and shouldn’t need support. As the silks appear and the cobs begin to form in late summer, they will benefit from watering in arid weather.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SWEETCORN USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In addition to its versatility, sweetcorn has been a staple food for centuries. It is a tasty addition to soups, salads, and pizza toppings. Cornmeal, polenta, cornmeal, and syrup can all be made with it directly off the cob. Vitamin C, abundant in corn, protects your cells from damage and helps prevent diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Corn is a good source of the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, which are essential for maintaining good eye health and preventing cataracts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product type: </span></strong>Sweetcorn Seeds</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zone: </span></strong>4<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">-8</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fast Growing</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fertile, Moist</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Harvest Time: </span></strong>3<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">-4 Months</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<strong>Scientific name: </strong>Zea mays subsp. mays<br>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<strong>Order: </strong>Poales</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<strong>Higher classification: </strong>Corn<br>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<strong>Rank: </strong>Subspecies<br>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<strong>Family: </strong>Poaceae<br>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<strong>Subfamily: </strong>Panicoideae</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Uses:</strong> Beneficial Vegetables</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-7 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Approximately ten weeks before your local last frost date, start the onion seeds indoors and transplant them outdoors. Plant them one-quarter inch deep. Ideally, it needs a sunny and fertile site with good drainage and fertile soil. Germination takes about 4-10 days when planted indoors. The plants should be transplanted outdoors just before the last frost. Whenever you transplant seedlings, space them at least six inches apart. <br> </span></div>\n<h2><strong>CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF SPRING ONION</strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plant your onions in an area with good drainage. It is best to plant onion seedlings in the least weedy part of your garden; onion seedlings are tiny and do not compete well with weeds. Before the last frost, make a large furrow in your soil, at least four inches deep. Prepare your seedlings for transplanting by watering this furrow before planting. Onion growth can be affected by bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SPRING ONION USAGE AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crisp salads of shredded vegetables or fish dishes are excellent with Dark Onion. Sprinkle on fresh chutneys and raitas, partly for their flavor. Dark Onions contain antioxidants and compounds that fight inflammation, reduce triglyceride levels and lower cholesterol levels. All of which may lower heart disease risk. Additionally, their potent anti-inflammatory properties may help to reduce high blood pressure and prevent blood clots.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Inf</span>ormation provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Winter</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 5-6</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 120-150 days.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Loamy</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 10-20 degrees Celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Monocots</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asparagales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Amaryllidaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subfamily:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Allioideae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Allium</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> A.

It’s better to plant them 1/2\" deep in compost-enriched soil in full sun. For harvesting the entire plant, space the plants 4-5\" apart. In order to harvest continuously the outer stalks, space the plants 8-10\" apart. For a continuous summer crop, plant seeds every two weeks. The seeds should germinate after a week. Swiss chard can survive light frosts, so it can also be planted in the fall.</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF SWISS CHARD</b></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a layer of mulch, you can ensure that the soil remains moist and weed-free. At the beginning of their growth, seedlings are especially dependent on moisture. As soon as the leaves reach a height of 6-8\" they can be harvested for greens. The whole plant can be harvested at the soil surface, but to ensure continued growth, leave an inch of stem. You can also harvest the outer stalks, leaving the inner stalks to grow.</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">SWISS CHARD USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</b></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chard can be steamed or sauteed, and it adds flavor to soups, stews, casseroles, frittatas, and quiches. The young leaves are edible raw in salads. Chard always has green leaves, but the stalks vary in color. Swiss chard is a good source of vitamin C, magnesium, and vitamin A. In addition, beta-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin are antioxidants in Swiss chard. Many organs, including the heart, lungs, and kidneys, require vitamin A for normal development and maintenance.</span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><i data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Note:</i></b></span><i data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></i></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Specifications:</b></p>\n<ul data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Product type:</b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Swiss Chard, Mangold Seeds, </span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">USDA Zone: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6-10</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Feature:</b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Continuous summer</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Soil:</b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fertile, Compost-mixed</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Harvest Time: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4-6 Weeks</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Kingdom:</b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Scientific name: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Higher classification: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beet</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Rank: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subspecies </span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Use:</b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Healthy</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries:</strong> 3-7 working days. <br>Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world:</strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br>Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.</p>\n</div>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></span><br>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Sow at a depth of four times the size of the seed in rows that are 50cm to 1m apart. A regular supply can be assured by sowing every second week until early spring. It takes 7 to 10 days for Red Strawberry Corn to germinate. You should not plant ten days to 2 weeks after the last killing frost. Spring and summer are ideal months to seed. Potted indoors, it can be planted throughout the year.</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF RED</span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> SWEETCORN </span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It can grow in fertile, well-drained soil, but it is not resistant to cold or heat. You can reap a better harvest by giving your Strawberry Corn plants high-nitrogen fertilizer. Red Strawberry Corn is ready for harvest once the silks have dried, which may take up to three weeks after silking. Strawberry Corn is wind-pollinated. It's better to plant four or more short, side-by-side rows than 1 or 2 long rows. The pollination process will be facilitated. The results can be improved with regular watering.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">BENEFITS OF RED SWEETCORN</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Unlike strawberries, the fruit is small, lovely, and deep purple. The fruit is sweet and nutritionally rich. It can be eaten raw and maintained directly in the open field. There is evidence that red corn can heal the nervous system and reverse diabetes as well. Red Strawberry corn contains 350% more antioxidants than common white or yellow corn. It has an abundance of health benefits as well as is beautiful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Germination temperature</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">：20-25°C</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">growth temperature</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">：20-35°C</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Color:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> red</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 80-100 CM</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Flowering time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">June to October</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Monocots, Commelinids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Poales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Poaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subfamily: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Panicoideae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Zea </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Z. mays</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries:</strong> 3-7 working days. <br>Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world:</strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br>Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.</p>\n</div>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></span><br>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Use good seed compost and ensure that you keep the soil moist. Most germinating seeds will take about 14 days to germinate. Transplant when they are large enough to handle all risk of frosts, 20 to 40cm apart. When established, the plants do not respond well to transplantation, so transplant seedlings into individual pots while still relatively small and once they have grown their first two true leaves.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF STRAWBERRY STICKS </span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is effortless to grow Strawberry Sticks alias Chenopodium foliosum. Once the last expected frost has passed, transplant the plants into their permanent positions. This quickly grown plant tolerates considerable neglect and succeeds in most soils and situations. The plants need to be honed and watered regularly. Water regularly to get a better result but make sure you don’t overwater them and the soil does not become soggy. Plants that are 45 to 60 days old can be harvested just a few leaves at a time until they are fully established. The refrigerator does not store it well, so pick it up right away.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">STRAWBERRY STICKS AND BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Strawberry Stick is an attractive plant with a branching habit that produces quantities of light green leaves similar to spinach that can be cooked. It also has stems covered with pink strawberry-like fruit that can be eaten fresh. This root-like vegetable is crispy, sweet, and delicious, white but marred with red beet, a bit bitter, and can be eaten raw or cooked in soups.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>\n<strong>Product:</strong> Strawberry Sticks Seeds</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sowing Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">February to April</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height:  </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">40cmcm</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 1 to 6 weeks</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloom Time:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> three months</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 2 - 8</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Caryophyllales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Amaranthaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Blitum </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> B. capitatum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Sweet and delicious fruit</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-7 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Italian Basil seeds can be sown from February to May in small pots or fine seedbeds. For best results, a fine layer of compost or soil should be applied to the basil seeds. Plants may be grown inside all year round, with germination taking 15-20 days if the soil is kept moist. Basil Italian ideally grows above 20 Celsius. It is possible to plant basil seeds directly outdoors in the late spring and summer.</div>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF ITALIAN BASIL </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You have to water the tiny plants regularly. Italian Basil  enjoys staying moist and grows best if watered once a week. Feed basil lightly since the plant grows vigorously and requires very little fertilizer. Once the basil plant has two sets of true leaves, pinch off the tips of the leaves. Plants need sun and heat to thrive, so Italian basil thrives in a tropical climate. Choose a location that receives six or eight hours of direct sunlight every day.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HEALTH BENEFITS OF ITALIAN BASIL</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As a herb, Italian Basil has a lot of health benefits.

You need eight or more hours of direct sunlight. Cover the bed with composted cow manure and till it in. Next year's giant pumpkin will benefit from the fertilized soil. Shape the bed into a broad mound, like a pitcher's mound, and cover it with straw mulch or cover crops for the winter. Plant pumpkin seeds a month or so before your area's average date of the last frost in peat pots in late winter or early spring. As soon as your most vigorous seedling has several leaves, transplant it into the bed, you prepared in the fall. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR GIANT PUMPKIN SEEDS AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To protect the pumpkin seedling from late frosts and warm up the soil, cover it with a cold frame to protect it and encourage it to grow. Make sure the soil is moist every day. It is essential to keep the ground wet but not soggy at all times. Wetting the leaves encourages fungal growth, so water at ground level (a drip system is ideal for this). Fertilize weekly with light nutrients. In the top third of the growing season, use products high in nitrogen, such as fish emulsion; in the middle third, use products high in phosphorous, such as bone meal; in the third phase, use products high in potassium, such as greensand.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF GIANT PUMPKIN</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Technically you can eat giant pumpkins, but they are mainly made of water and are very bland in taste. Also, since pumpkins grow so fast and absorb nutrients and fertilizers, they could contain some nasty things that you do not want to eat. Farmers load the giant pumpkins into the back of pickup trucks throughout the country and drive them into town to be weighed. Growers earn thousands of dollars in prize money from vegetables that weigh more than two tons or two thousand pounds.</span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"color: #4f9707;\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><i data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Note:</i></b></span><i data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></i></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Specifications:</b></p>\n<ul data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Product:</b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Giant Pumpkin Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Season:</b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">USDA Zones: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5a</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Days to Harvest:</b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 120-150 days.</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Soil Type:</b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Well-drained</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Temperature:</b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 20-25 Degrees Celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Kingdom: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Scientific name: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cucurbita maxima</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Family: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cucurbitaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Higher classification: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Squash</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Order: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cucurbitales</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Uses: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vegetable, Competition</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Drills 1.5 cm deep and 30 cm apart must be sown very thinly with the seed. It takes 12-20 days for the seed to germinate. When seedlings are large enough to handle thin to one every 7cm and then again three weeks later, to one every 15cm, you can eat the thinnings when the micro-leaf and baby leaf stages are present. Alternatively, you can start in early spring when the soil temperature is over 14 degrees Celsius. Plant-heavy seeds every 10-14 days in mid-to-late summer, at 30 seeds per foot, for fall harvest.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF SPINACH</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ensure the plants are well hydrated during dry times to prevent bolting. You should regularly pick your leaves to ensure new growth and healthy leaves. The best-growing conditions are fertile soil amended with compost or well-rotted manure—plant in autumn and cover with mulch to provide a spring harvest. You can either start them inside or transplant them later, but they are not recommended. The plants do not require much care, so you can begin to them outdoors and harvest them after one or two months.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SPINACH USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Heat-resistant spinach, characterized by its unique qualities, offers a variety of potential benefits.

You can direct sow with frost protection as early as late winter or without protection from early to late spring. Sowing short rows every three weeks allows for a continuous harvest of baby leaves and full-sized plants. Sow again in late summer for harvest in the fall and winter. A few seeds should be planted in each area you want to see a plant grow. Plant seeds 1cm deep and thin to the strongest plant, spaced 10-15cm apart in the row. The optimal soil temperature must be 21°C, and the seeds may sprout in a week. </p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </b><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">MUSTARD</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Three meters of row can be nourished with one cup of complete organic fertilizer. The seeds should be watered frequently for best results. Expect mustards to bolt in hot weather. Provide winter protection by using a cloche or heavy row cover. Plan to grow fast and harvest fast, like spinach, at all other times. The best method for the home garden for a constant harvest is to plant short rows every two weeks. Depending on the plant's maturity, you can cut individual leaves or the whole plant.</p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">MUSTARD </span></strong><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</b>\n</h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Mustard is a delicious topping for steamed or roasted vegetables despite its strange sound.

It's sweet, tangy, creamy, texture perfect, and it makes salads taste amazing. Mustards contain protein, fibre, vitamin C, and many B-complex vitamins.

Seeds of Rosemary take a very long time to germinate, and seedlings grow at a slow pace. The seedlings can be transplanted outside mid-spring, but they need to be started within 10 to 12 weeks before the last frost. The soilless potting mix should be used to fill seed starters. Unlike other plants that grow in rocky or sandy soil, rosemary seeds will perform better in a loose and light potting mix that doesn't contain soil. Each cell should have between three and four seeds. The seedlings can be transplanted outside when they reach the size of pots. A light layer of soil should be applied to the seeds. Sprinkle a minimal amount of regular potting soil over the entire surface of the growing medium to cover the seeds.</span></p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HERB ROSEMARY</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Once the seeds germinate, plant them out in permanent positions after the last expected frost. Their ideal place would be in full sun, with fertile soil that is not too wet. Despite having a low germination rate, 30cm Rosemary grows well if numerous seeds are planted in each cell. Seeds should not be pressed down into the potting medium; place them on top. Choose a location with full sun. Rosemary requires a lot of direct sunlight to thrive. It is best to place the plant somewhere that gets at least six to eight hours of sun per day.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USAGE u0026amp; HEALTH BENEFITS OF ROSEMARY</span></strong></h2>\n<p>Rosemary is a versatile herb that offers a range of uses and potential health benefits. While the specific effects of rosemary on health are still being studied, this herb has been valued for its culinary applications and aromatic qualities. Incorporating rosemary into cooking can add flavor and depth to various dishes, such as roasted meats, vegetables, and sauces.<br><br>Beyond its culinary uses, rosemary has been traditionally associated with specific health benefits. Some research suggests that rosemary contains compounds like carnosic acid and rosmarinic acid, which may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These properties have been linked to potential positive effects on overall health.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Product</strong>: Rosemary Seeds</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sowing Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">90 cm</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 6-12 Months</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloom Time:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spring-Summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 30 degrees F</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Lamiales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lamiaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Salvia </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> S.

Soak the seeds in water for 24 hours to facilitate water absorption and soften the hard outer shell. Prepare a germination tray or pot with a mixture of soil and compost, and moisten the soil surface. Sow the seeds on the surface of the soil, covering them with a light layer of soil, ensuring that they are not buried too deeply. Place the tray or pot in a warm, bright location, but not under direct sunlight. Maintain a consistently moist environment by spraying the soil surface with water regularly.</span></p>\n<h2><b>CARE FOR DENDROCALAMUS LATIFLORUS PLANTS AFTER GERMINATION</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the bamboo seeds have germinated and sprouted, gradually acclimate the plants to more sunlight, but avoid direct sunlight for the first few weeks. Water the plants regularly, keeping the soil moist but not waterlogged, and avoid letting the soil dry out completely. Apply a balanced fertilizer every two to four weeks to support healthy growth. As the plant grows, transplant it into a larger container or into the ground, ensuring that it has enough space to spread out its roots. Prune any dead or damaged leaves, and cut back any unwanted shoots to promote healthy growth. Protect the plant from strong winds, which can cause damage to the stems or leaves.</span></p>\n<h2><b>USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF DENDROCALAMUS LATIFLORUS</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dendrocalamus latiflorus, also known as Sweet Bamboo, is a versatile plant that is valued for its many uses and health benefits. The young shoots of Dendrocalamus latiflorus are edible and are considered a delicacy in many parts of Asia. They can be used in stir-fries, soups, and salads. What’s more? The tall, slender stems of Dendrocalamus latiflorus make it a popular ornamental plant. It is often used to create screens or hedges in gardens and parks.

Soil that is moderately acidic, well-drained, sunny, and well-drained. Bean plants should also be well-ventilated to prevent mildew or mold from promoting proper development. The same bean plant should not be grown more than once every four years, and beans can be grown with corn, strawberries, and cucumber. Fennel and onion should not be planted near beans. You should water the soil regularly and immediately after planting until it sprouts. You will need a structure to support the beans as they grow. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR STRING BEAN SEEDS AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ensure not to wet the leaves when watering beans, as this can promote fungus or other damaging conditions. Beans are generally drought-resistant but check the soil's surface frequently and water when the top layer becomes dry. It is usually unnecessary to fertilize string beans once they are established since they will provide their nitrogen. The plant can be fertilized with fish emulsion or other naturally nitrogen-rich fertilizers if the leaves of young plants are pale. Keep the bean plants well watered. Maintain moisture at the roots of the plants with mulch. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF STRING BEANS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Throw them into a salad, or add them to soups, stews, and braises. There are many ways to cook green beans in under 5 minutes, including boiling, steaming, and microwaving. They can be consumed on their own, in salads or hashes. Green beans are high in vitamin K and contain a decent amount of calcium. Maintaining strong, healthy bones is essential for reducing your risk of fractures. Getting enough folate is not just important when you're pregnant.

It is generally grown annually, planted in the spring, and takes 60-85 days to produce a crunchy, sweet purple fruit. Start planting seeds within 6-10 weeks before the final frost in your area and plant them when the seedlings have two leaves. Place transplants 18-24 inches apart with 2-3 feet between rows. Cauliflowers need space just like all vegetables. Cauliflower, in general, prefers less water. Please give it a bit of water each week. In addition to being thirsty, cauliflower is a food hog as well.</p>\n<h2>\n<b>CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </b><b>PURPLE CAULIFLOWER</b>\n</h2>\n<p>Compost the soil with 2-3 inches of organic matter before planting. You can add compost to the soil every few weeks after the seedlings have begun to grow until harvest time. Cauliflower also responds well to foliar fertilization with compost tea during the growing season. As summer wanes, it will be time to harvest. Just cut through the stalk under the head. Cauliflower does not like being interrupted in its growth. A change in temperature, moisture, soil nutrition, or insects may cause the plants to produce a head prematurely or ruin an existing one. So be careful about these factors.</p>\n<h2>\n<b>PURPLE CAULIFLOWER </b><b>USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</b>\n</h2>\n<p>Despite its colorful pigments, this cauliflower is perfectly safe to eat. While we prefer white cauliflower, some cultivars are purple, orange, light green, and yellow—no need for concern. Perhaps you purchased a purple plant along with the white ones. The presence of an antioxidant called anthocyanin makes purple cauliflower unique among other varieties of this vegetable. This type of cauliflower is rich in anthocyanin, reducing inflammation and preventing heart disease.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><b><i>Note:</i></b></span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Specifications:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Product Type:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Purple Cauliflower Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>USDA Zone: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7-11</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Sunlight: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Full Sun</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Soil:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Compost Mixed</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Harvest Time: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 65-70 days</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Scientific Name: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brassica oleracea var. botrytis</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Kingdom: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Higher classification: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wild cabbage</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Rank: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cultivar</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Genus: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cabbages</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Use:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Beneficial Vegetable</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Plant your seeds indoors in pots several weeks before your average last frost date when the temperature is between 21 and 25 degrees Celsius. The seeds will usually germinate in just a few days. Water the soil evenly every two to three days during the growing season. Feed your plant fertilizer once a week. A warm or hot climate is required to grow and harvest Cherry Tomatoes. Before planting your plants outdoors, ensure that all frost risks have been eliminated.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF RED CHERRY TOMATO </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ensure that your tomato seedlings receive excess light each day to avoid them getting leggy. If the roots increase, they may need to be transplanted into a larger pot. In the early stages of growing Cherry Tomatoes, fertilizer is often applied. Depending on the variety's mature size, a cage, ladder, or another vertical support may be needed at planting.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">RED CHERRY TOMATO BENEFITS AND USAGE </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can make a sweet and juicy pico de gallo or avocado salsa with cherry tomatoes to serve with fish tacos or flatbread. Making sour soup with them is possible. You can make yummy tomato sauce by cooking whole Cherry Tomatoes.

Perennials need to be started about two months before the onset of frost to thrive. If they are to be grown indoors, they may also be created year-round. Put the seeds in the flat of the seedling and cover them with the medium. Covering the seeds will prevent them from germinating. They should sprout at room temperature or slightly warmer than room temperature in 10 to 15 days. After growing two sets of true leaves, transplant them into the garden or container. In the case of outdoor planting, you can sprinkle vermiculite over well-worked soil before sowing the seeds. Consider covering the seeds with a row cover until they sprout if you are planting directly in the garden.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> <strong>OF MINT </strong></span>\n</h2>\n<p>Mint is perennial and needs very little care. Ensure the soil is lightly moist but not soggy, and keep the flats in a warm location. A cover over the flat can speed germination. Remove it once you see sprouts. After having two true leaves, the seeds should be hardened off, then planted in beds or pots outdoors. Taking potted plants outside to acclimate to outdoor conditions for a week before moving them into the ground is the best way to transplant them. Water new plants regularly. This plant needs between 2.5 and 5 cm of height. The growing season requires approximately one gallon per week of water. Allow the leaves to dry by using drip irrigation or watering in the morning. The wetness of the leaves may result in a fungus infection.  Early spring is the finest time to apply fertilizer.</p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HEALTH BENEFITS OF MINT</span></strong></h2>\n<p>Fresh or dried, Mint can be used in various dishes and infusions. Many toothpaste tubes, chewing gum, candy, and beauty products contain mint oil. Mint may have several potential health benefits. Relaxation of muscles and gastrointestinal problems may be managed with Mint. Humans have used the calming properties of Mint for a long time to help soothe indigestion and upset stomachs. The anti-inflammatory acid rosmarinic acid contained in mint plants prevents allergies.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product: </span></strong>Green Mint Seeds<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><br>Sowing Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Any</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">120 cm</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 90 Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloom Time:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> June - September</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 55-70 degrees F</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Lamiales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lamiaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subfamily: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Nepetoideae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tribe: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mentheae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mentha</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Beneficial Herb</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Information:</span></strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ireland u0026amp; Northern Ireland:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Orders placed before 4 p.m. will be delivered the next day, otherwise usually two working days. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> From 2,00 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rest of the World :</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-11 Working Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From 2,90 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">- Except</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> for Australia u0026amp; New Zealand, shipping costs are from 3.50 Euros.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at<span> </span></span><b>Garden Paradise Seeds</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are dedicated to providing the best quality products with the best customer service in the entire market.

Plant dill in full sun, as Diana will grow well in light shade, but it will not grow as bushy. The best soil for growing Dill Diana is one that is well-drained and contains lots of organic matter. Add aged compost to the planting bed in advance of planting. It is best to start Dill seeds indoors 4 to 6 weeks before transplanting them outdoors. Diana prefers soil pH ranges from 5.5 to 6.7. Seedlings from taproots that transplant poorly is best for starting dill Diana and growing in place.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HEALTH BENEFITS OF HERB DILL</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Dill is packed with antioxidants and a good source of vitamin C, magnesium, and vitamin A. It may protect against heart disease and cancer. This time of year, Anethum graveolens, also known as Dill Diana, is the perfect plant to have on hand to soothe indigestion. You can make tea from the seeds and leaves to relieve wind-induced stomach aches, and dill water will soothe colic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sowing Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">May - June</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Water Tolerance: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">No</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 70 Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloom Time:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 15-18 degree celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Apiales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Apiaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subfamily: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Apioideae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tribe:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Apieae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Anethum L. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> A. graveolens</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Beneficial Herb</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Early in the summer, seeds can be planted outside in well-prepared soil or in pots filled with multipurpose compost. The seeds should be thinly sown and lightly covered. Germination will usually take between 7-20 days. For a constant supply of leaves, plant every three to four weeks. You must thin your seedlings so that there is a gap of 10cm between plants and ensure that they are in a sunny spot. Keeping the seed moist and well-covered is part of the benefits of sowing undercover.

Moisture should be maintained in soil and compost, but overwatering should be avoided. Premature flowering can be caused by dry soil or compost. Plants usually are not fed, but occasionally providing them with some liquid fertilizer can be helpful. To prevent a halt to growth, weed regularly around seed-producing plants. Keep the moisture level constant.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HEALTH BENEFITS OF CORIANDER </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As an herb coriander has a lot of health benefits. It does not only taste great but is also rich in antioxidants, beta-carotene, and folate. When your cells are protected from oxidative stress, your skin feels soft, supple, and glowing. Small amounts of calcium, potassium, niacin, and phosphorus are also present. Coriander leaves contain many beneficial properties, including improving blood sugar levels, boosting immunity, promoting digestion, improving kidney function, etc.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sowing Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">March-September</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Water Tolerance:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> No</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloom Time:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 20-30 Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 10-50 degrees F</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Apiales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Apiaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Coriandrum </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> C. sativum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> In many dishes</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

The previous fall, prepare beds by working in manure or compost and raking smooth to leave a fine seedbed. Seeds need light to germinate; sow at a very shallow depth by covering a thin layer of growing medium. Sow seed 1cm deep, an inch apart, in rows fifteen inches apart. Cut back to twelve inches after plants have four or five true leaves. Also, loose-leaf seed can be lightly broadcast in a patch instead of a row.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF LOOSE-LEAF LETTUCE</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Reduce the temperature and water for three days before transplanting seedlings. Make rows 18 inches apart and space transplants 12 inches apart. Moisture, stress, and high temperatures, particularly at night, encourage bolting. During the growing season, plant bolt-resistant varieties. Place your plants where they will be partially shaded by taller nearby plants, latticework, or other screens. Lettuce has shallow roots. Keep soil moist to keep plants growing continuously. Mulch to retain moisture and prevent weed growth. Fertilizing can help promote faster growth, mainly if the fish emulsion is not high in nitrogen that can cause the greens to taste bitter. Make sure to water gently and consistently.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">LOOSE-LEAF LETTUCE USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The most widely planted type of lettuce, loose-leaf lettuce, is commonly known for its loosely bunched leaves. It is used mainly for salads. This type is also used for burgers and sandwiches and forms long, upright heads. It is the lettuce used most often in Caesar salads. Lettuce is a source of vitamin K, which helps strengthen bones. It is also possible to reduce the risk of bone fractures by consuming adequate amounts of vitamin K. The majority of raw lettuce is water. So, lettuce helps you stay hydrated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product Type: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Loose Leaf Lettuce Seed</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zone: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">6-8</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moist Resistant</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Well Drained, Moist</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Harvest Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">45 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asterales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asteraceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tribe: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cichorieae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lactuca</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">L.

You can start Snake Gourd seeds indoors early by soaking them overnight. On top of your refrigerator or another warm place, place the cracked seeds in a bowl of warm water. Transfer the seedlings outside into topsoil and soil that has been well-mixed with organic matter. You can also plant seeds in large peat or flower pots after soaking them in a moist seed-starting mix. To help keep the moisture in, wrap the pots in plastic wrap.

Snake gourds should be watered every two weeks or whenever the soil feels dry after you plant them. The gourd vines need additional nutrients after three weeks of planting seedlings in compost. To support their fruits, Snake gourd plants need a large trellis. It usually takes about forty to fifty days for Snake Gourd to be harvested. <br></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SNAKE GOURD'S BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A lot of health benefits are associated with snake gourd.

Start the seeds either indoors in late winter or directly in the garden in spring. A full sun location and rich, well-drained soil are ideal for growing cinnamon basil. Start indoors 6 to 8 weeks before the last frost date. The seeds will germinate in 5 to 10 days. Plant the seedlings into the garden or your best containers when they have two sets of true leaves. Spacing them 24 to 30 inches apart is ideal. It would help if you waited until spring has thoroughly warmed up the soil before direct-sowing. Soil should be covered about 1/4 inches away from the seeds.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">BASIL CINNAMON</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Remember that basil needs rich, moist soil and enjoys hot weather. Plants should be mulched to retain moisture and should be watered heavily during periods of drought. Basil can be forced to grow sideways and into a bushy growth and full bloom by pinching the tip off the center shoot after it grows for six weeks. Whenever flower stalks appear, snip them off. The soil needs to be lightly moist but not soggy when growing Cinnamon basil plants.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">WHAT IS BASIL CINNAMON?</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Basil cinnamon is very easy to cultivate, delicious, and useful in the garden. There is something irresistible about that spicy-sweet scent, those bright red stems, and those pink blooms. In addition to being useful for diarrhea and constipation, basil is good for cough, headache, and warts. The cinnamon flavor makes it a favorite in Thai and Italian cuisines. It is highly recommended that you use the herb as a tea to reap the most significant benefit. Herbs are generally considered to be beneficial.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Product:</strong> Basil Cinnamon Seeds</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 10-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 60 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 12-24 inches</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Loam</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 27 degrees Celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Lamiales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ocimum - Basils</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ocimum </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ocimum basilicum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Beneficial Herb</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Information:</span></strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ireland u0026amp; Northern Ireland:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Orders placed before 4 p.m. will be delivered the next day, otherwise usually two working days. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> From 2,00 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rest of the World :</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-11 Working Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From 2,90 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">- Except</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> for Australia u0026amp; New Zealand, shipping costs are from 3.50 Euros.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at<span> </span></span><b>Garden Paradise Seeds</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are dedicated to providing the best quality products with the best customer service in the entire market.

Try mixing with sand and then sprinkle the sand-seed mix over the potting soil. Sprinkle a little soil over the seeds. Celery seeds should be planted shallowly once the celery seeds have sprouted and are large enough; either thin the seedlings or prick them out to their pots. </span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF NOBLE CELERY</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The best time to plant celery in the garden is once the temperatures outside are consistently above 10 degrees Celsius. Remember that celery plants are susceptible to temperature, so don't plant them too soon, or they will die. For best results, plant your celery where it gets six hours of sun, yet preferably somewhere that will keep it shaded during the hottest part of the day. Also, make sure that where you will be growing celery has rich soil. Celery grows best in soil that is rich in nutrients. Plants need a lot of water to grow. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">NOBLE CELERY USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Having celery leaves in hand, you need a plan for how to use them. The leaves still pack more celery punch than the stalks. You'll be surprised at how much flavor they have, but the tender texture makes them suitable to eat raw.

Transplant out after 4-6 weeks after the last frost, or start indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost. The optimal soil temperature must be 10-30°C and the seeds germinate in 7-10 days. You can sow thinly in March-May, in a seedbed, 1.5cm deep, directly into finely-prepared, well-cultivated, fertile soil, which has already been watered. Seedlings usually appear in 14-21 days. Be sure to water the plants well for the first few weeks. Floating row covers are an effective way to prevent cabbage moths and other insect pests.</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF GREEN KALE</b></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plant Green Kale seedlings 45 cm apart when they are about 10 cm tall. Water well after planting. Kale likes soils that drain well and contain a lot of organic matter. This plant prefers plentiful, consistent moisture. The quality and flavor of leaves can suffer due to drought. One-fourth cup of complete organic fertilizer should be incorporated into the soil beneath each transplant, or one cup under every 3m of the seed furrow. By direct-seeding and cutting at 5-8cm tall, kale and collards can be grown as a cut-and-come-again crop for salad mixes. Those plants will grow again. </span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">GREEN KALE USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</b></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is often eaten raw in salads and smoothies, but can also be steamed, sautéed, boiled, or baked. In addition to broccoli and Brussels sprouts, kale is a cruciferous vegetable that offers a wide range of health benefits.  The amount of vitamins A, K, B6, C, calcium, potassium, copper, and manganese that it contains makes it a nutrition superstar. One cup of raw kale has just 33 calories and only 7 grams of carbohydrate. The vegetable is also very weight-friendly and diabetes-friendly.</span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><i data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Note:</i></b></span><i data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></i></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Specifications:</b></p>\n<ul data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Product type:</b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Green Kale Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">USDA Zone: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7-09</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Feature:</b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Tolerant</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Soil:</b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fertile, well-drained</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Harvest Time: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">55-70 days</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Kingdom:</b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Scientific name: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brassica oleracea var. sabellica</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Higher classification: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wild cabbage</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Rank: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Variety</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Use:</b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Salad, Cooked</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

The seeds can be sown to a depth of 2.5 to 5 cm. In the process of growing spaghetti Squash, plant two seeds per hole in the ground spaced one to two meters apart. Once the seeds sprout, cut off the weakest seedling at its base to thin the plants down to one strong seedling per hole. Spread 2 meters of straw or untreated grass clippings around the planting holes to ensure that the creeper grows well. Make 1-2 meters of soil mixed with compost, 20-30 cm high. </span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span><br>\n</div>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SPAGHETTI PUMPKIN</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You don't have to worry much while caring for this. Mulch your soil with black plastic to keep weeds at bay while promoting soil warmth and water conservation. Make sure to water the plants 3-5 cm. each week. Spaghetti squash may mature after three months. It is best to keep spaghetti squash in a cool and dry area, between 50 and 13 Celsius.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HEALTH BENEFITS OF SPAGHETTI SQUASH</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In addition to protecting cells from damage, spaghetti squash may also help prevent cancer.

In the same way, we described our green globe; you can apply the same method here. Here is a small detail in some cases. During March and April, seed 13mm deep in a seedbed. Spread two or three seeds in each pot of 3 to 4 inches. Compost-rich soil-based medium should fill up two-thirds of the pot. In each row, sow two to three seeds. Thin to leave the strongest seedling.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION ARTICHOKE</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When growing artichokes, be patient. A plant grown from seed will reach maturity in 110-150 days, and a plant grown from the division will reach maturity in 100 days. The majority of plants do not flower until they are two years old. After the harvest has been completed, cut the plants back to an inch or two off the ground for a second harvest. At the plant's base, new sprouts will appear. Planting them too close together can shade small plants because artichoke plants need full sunlight.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">KNOW ABOUT PURPLE ARTICHOKE</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Raw artichokes retain a much firmer texture and a bitter taste. In addition to softening the texture, cooking also gives it a blender flavor similar to boiled potatoes. Thistle varieties cultivated as food include the globe artichoke, French artichoke, and green artichoke in North America. The edible portion of the plant consists of the flower buds before the flowers come into bloom.  </span></p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em><span style=\"color: #e82212;\"><strong>Note:</strong></span> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</em></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em></em></span></div>\n<div data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em></em></span></div>\n<div data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Specifications:</strong><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></span></div>\n<div data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Product: </strong>Romanesco Artichoke Seeds </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Season:</strong> March</li>\n<li>\n<strong>USDA Zones:</strong> 7-11</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Days to Harvest:</strong> 180 Days.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Height:</strong> 3 Feet</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Bloom Season:</strong> Winter</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Soil Type:</strong> Loam</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Temperature:</strong> 10 Degree Celcius</li>\n<li>\n<b>Kingdom: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Clade:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tracheophytes,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Order:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asterales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Family: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asteraceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Genus:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cynara </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Species: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C. cardunculus </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Variety: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C. c. var. scolymus</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b></b><b>Uses: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beneficial Vegetable</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<h4 data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Information:</span></strong><br>\n</h4>\n<div data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ireland u0026amp; Northern Ireland:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Orders placed before 4 p.m. will be delivered the next day, otherwise usually two working days. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> From 2,00 Euros</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rest of the World :</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-11 Working Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From 2,90 Euros<br></span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">- Except</strong> for Australia u0026amp; New Zealand, shipping costs are from 3.50 Euros.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at </span><b>Garden Paradise Seeds</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are dedicated to providing the best quality products with the best customer service in the entire market.

You will only need three to four seeds per hole if each hole is spaced about three feet apart. You can thin the weakest plants after they germinate, which should take between 10 and 20 days. The seeds of milk thistle can be planted in seed trays filled with potting soil, then covered with a soft layer of soil when grown indoors. The tray will need to remain in an area that remains at 18 degrees celsius and then watered daily until the germination of the seeds occurs.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR MILK THISTLE AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The milk thistle is a hardy plant that grows well in various environments but prefers high temperatures and dry conditions. A well-draining soil is the only requirement for milk thistle. It is recommended to space the plants 30-38 cm apart as it grows in clumps. Milk thistle prefers dry conditions and is extremely drought tolerant. Watering milk thistle should not be necessary unless very extreme drought conditions exist. To increase the seed production of milk thistle, you can fertilize this plant with nitrogen and potassium.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF MILK THISTLE</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Skin health may be improved with milk thistle. According to a 2015 study, it helped treat inflammatory skin conditions when applied to mice's skin. According to another study, milk thistle also had antioxidant and anti-aging effects on human skin cells in a laboratory setting. According to some studies, milk thistle can slow the skin's aging process because it is antiglycation. The bridges between protein and sugar are what make skin supple. These start to break down around age 30 and increase steadily as you age.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #199c0e;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #199c0e;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.<br><br></span></em><strong><span id=\"Toxicity\" class=\"mw-headline\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\">Toxicity</span>:</span></strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Milk thistle (Silybum Marianum) established supplements include been measured to deliver the highest mycotoxin concentrations of up to 35 mg/kg when approximated to diverse plant-based dietary supplements<br></span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Milk Thistle Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Early spring</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span></strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 5-9</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 60 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> All varieties</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">32-86° F</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Silybum marianum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asteraceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Asterales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Higher classification:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Silybum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Silybum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">S. marianum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Flower</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

The soil should be rich in organic matter and well-drained. Prepare the bed beforehand by working in aged compost. Fennel is a perennial plant that grows as an annual in cool climates. You can sow it in the garden as early as 2 to 3 weeks before spring's average last frost date. Germination occurs at a temperature of 17°C or higher. Fennel tolerates heat and cold but does best in cool weather when maturing. Fennel seed should be sown at a depth of 14 inches at a distance of four to six inches. Successful seedlings should be thinned to 12 inches apart. Leave 24 to 36-inch spacing between rows. A companion plant that grows well with mints can be a member of the mint family.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR FLORENCE FENNEL AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Florence Fennel should be kept dry; the soil should be evenly moist but not soggy. The soil should be mulched to retain moisture in hot climates. Planting beds should be prepared with aged compost. Fennel should be side-dressed with aged compost midseason. The flower stems should be barren when the bulbous base reaches the size of an egg—mulch up around the bulb. When harvested, the bulb will have a sweeter taste. Remove seed stalks to increase the number of stems and bulbs. Leave the fennel unattended, and it will self-seed. Parsley caterpillars may attack the fennel plant. Remove them manually. There are no severe other pest problems with the fennel.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF FLORENCE FENNEL</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can grill, braise, boil, or sautée Florence fennel. It can also be blanched or braised with other vegetables—puree-cooked fennel and season with butter, salt, and pepper as a side dish. Cut fennel into long, uncooked strips and serve them in salads. A fresh fennel bulb is a good source of vitamin C, a water-soluble vitamin essential for immune system health, tissue repair, and collagen synthesis. Also, vitamin C operates as an antioxidant in your body, preventing cellular damage caused by unstable molecules called free radicals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product type: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Florence Fennel Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zone: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">9b</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fertile, Loamy Soil</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Harvest Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">14 Weeks</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fast Growing</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 17 Degree C</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Apiales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Apiaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Foeniculum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">F.

Firm the mixture, but please don't compact it. Now, place a few seeds into each small container or each seed starter cell. It is recommended to cover the seed with about 1cm of soil and gently firm it over. The seed and mixture should be watered together. Water can be dripped over the plant using a plant mister or simply dribbling a stream over it. There is not necessary to soak the soil; moisten the top layer. Place the pots on top of a heat mat. The seeds don't need light at this stage. You can cover the pots with plastic kitchen wrap. But remember that when you see the seeds sprout, remove the covering and place the pots in a sunny window.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR TOMATOES AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Maintain the soil's moisture but do not let it become saturated. Providing good air circulation reduces the chances of disease problems, such as damping off. Plants on a windowsill should be rotated daily to grow upright instead of leaning toward the light. You should raise the lights as the plants grow, keeping them just a few inches above the plants. Only one seedling should be planted per pot or cell to ensure the strongest, healthiest plants. Fertilizing begins when the second set of true leaves appears. Once or twice a week, apply a water-soluble fertilizer that's been mixed half as much as the recommended rate.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF TOMATOES</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tomatoes can be eaten fresh, straight from the vine. Make tomato salad, and also tomato sandwiches are delicious to eat. Cook some homemade tomato soup or juice them. Are you not getting any idea? Make fresh salsa, like home-canned salsa.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Another perfect thing you can make is hot tomato sauce. The antioxidant lycopene is a significant component of tomatoes, and it has been linked to several health benefits, including the prevention of heart illness and cancer. As well as being a great source of vitamin C, potassium, folate, and vitamin K, they are also a good source of fibre and iron.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product type: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tomato Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zone: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">5-8</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Most useful</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fertile, Well Drained, Moist</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Harvest Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">50-60 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Solanales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Solanaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Solanum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">S.

This reduces the need for thinning out, makes the use of seeds more economical, and, given the protection of a greenhouse or cold frame, means sowing can start at least a month earlier in late winter. Prepare plug trays by filling them with seed-starting or general-purpose potting mix and pressing it down firmly into the cells. Plant about four or eight seeds per cell and cover with more potting mix to a depth of nearly a quarter to half an inch or 1 cm. Use a fine spray of water.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF YELLOW ONIONS</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To prevent disturbing the roots, transplant the seedlings while they're still young. Plant the seedlings about 10 cm apart, firm them into the prepared ground, and water them using a hole punch. Add aged manure or compost to the fall or early spring soil. Onion plants are heavy feeders to produce large bulbs and require constant nourishment. Make sure you fertilize with nitrogen every few weeks to get big bulbs. Once the onions have pushed the soil away and the bulbing process has begun, stop fertilizing. You cannot put the soil back around the onions because the bulb needs room to grow.</span></p>\n</div>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">YELLOW ONIONS </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Depending on age, it can be mild to pungent, but it becomes mellower when cooked. For caramelizing, yellow is ideal. The yellow onion is your best friend when you are sautéing onions as a base for your dish (soup, tomato sauce, whatever). The compounds in onions help fight inflammation, reduce triglycerides, and lower cholesterol, reducing the risk of heart disease. They are also believed to lower blood pressure and prevent blood clots due to their potent anti-inflammatory properties.</span></p>\n<p><span><em><strong><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #ff2a00;\">Note</span>:</strong> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</em></span></p>\n<p><b>Specifications:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Product Type:</b> F1 Yellow Onion Seeds</li>\n<li>\n<b>USDA Zone: </b>5-6</li>\n<li>\n<b>Feature:<span> </span></b>Easy To Grow</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Soil:</strong><span> Compost mixed</span>, Well-drained</li>\n<li>\n<b>Harvest Time: </b>100-120 days</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<div>\n<strong>Kingdom:</strong> Plantae<br>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<div>\n<strong>Clade:</strong> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Monocots<br>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<div>\n<strong>Order:</strong> Asparagales<br>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<div>\n<strong>Family:</strong> Amaryllidaceae<br>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<div>\n<strong>Subfamily:</strong> Allioideae<br>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<div>\n<strong>Genus:</strong> Allium<br>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<div>\n<strong>Species:</strong> A. cepa</div>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<strong>Use:</strong><span> Salad </span>or Cooked</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-7 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

To germinate, seeds need light. Plant the seeds less than a centimetre deep, one inch apart in rows and twelve to eighteen inches apart. For crisphead varieties, you can thin after they have two or three true leaves, and for other types, you can thin when they have six to ten leaves. Additionally, you can lightly broadcast seed (particularly loose-leaf varieties) in a patch rather than in a row. For three days before transplanting, reduce the water and temperature for the seedlings. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR GREEN ROMAINE LETTUCE AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When the weather is warm, row covers can be used to protect plants, protect young plants from insects, and (supported by hoops) shade crops. Plants should be positioned partially shaded by taller nearby plants, latticework, or other screens. Salad lettuce has a shallow root system. Make sure the soil is moist to ensure plants grow continuously. Maintain moisture and suppress weeds with mulch (unless slugs are a problem). Fertilize to encourage faster growth. Keep the soil moist but not saturated. Seedlings are not as tolerant of freezing as mature plants.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF GREEN ROMAINE LETTUCE</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is mild in taste and crisp in texture, and it has sturdy leaves that make it better heat tolerant than other lettuce varieties. Salad greens are most commonly prepared, though they can also be grilled and sautéed. Along with other vegetables, romaine has become a grilling staple in recent years. In addition to being a healthy part of a balanced diet, Romaine lettuce can provide even more health benefits if eaten regularly. Leafy greens are lower in calories and high in nutritional value, making them an excellent and healthy addition to any diet.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Note:</span></em></strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product Type: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Romaine Lettuce Seed</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zone: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">8 Above</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Heat Tolerant</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fertile, Well Drained</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Harvest Season: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asterales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asteraceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tribe: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cichorieae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lactuca</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">L.

Pre-soak the seeds in warm water 1 hour before sowing, and this will help speed up germination. Sow beetroot seeds outdoors from mid-April to late June into a shallow drill, 1cm deep. Space seeds 10cm apart, with 30cm between rows. Water regularly and keep the area free from weeds. Direct sow beetroot seeds indoors from March to July in a weed-free, sunny position in fertile, light, well-drained soil. Sow beetroot seeds thinly in shallow drills at a depth of 1cm and 30cm apart. Now, wait with patience for your next care.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF BOLTARDY </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">BEETROOT </span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\">Germination will usually take 12 to 24 days. When large enough to handle, thin out the seedlings within each row to 5 - 7cm apart. Water the beetroot regularly after the seeds germinate. This reduces the likelihood of the roots becoming woody or splitting. Chop around the plants to keep the row weed-free, being careful not to damage the swelling beetroot. Most of the globe types are ready to harvest in 8-10 weeks; longer, cylindrical varieties take 20 weeks. Beetroot Germinates at 8 - 25°C.<br></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HOW TO HARVEST </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">BOLTARDY </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">BEETROOTS</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yahoo! It's time. While harvesting beetroot, grasp the foliage firmly where it meets the top of the root and pull. Beetroot is better harvested too early rather than too late – younger roots are tenderers. Pull roots the size of a cricket ball or smaller and store only those that are undamaged. After lifting, twist off foliage about 5cm from the root, leaving short stalks. Pull the beetroot when the roots are 1 1/2\" in diameter or more extensive.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> April to June</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 2-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 7-8 Weeks.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 2 Feet</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Loam</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 8-25 Degrees C</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-7 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At <strong>Garden</strong></span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Seed should be sown from March to April at 16-18°C in modules or in open ground. In each 3 to 4-inch pot, plant two or three seeds. The pot should be stocked two-thirds full with a good quality soil-based medium containing compost. Adding a little perlite will help improve drainage if the potting mix feels heavy. Cover your seeds with a light dusting of the potting mix after you have sprinkled them in the pot. Make sure to soak the pots well and let them drain well after this first watering. Remember to never make the soil waterlogged, but also not to let heavy soils dry out.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">GERMINATION AND CARE OF GREEN GLOBE ARTICHOKE</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\">Artichoke seeds are best germinated in February or March, but they can be started as early as January or as late as the middle of March. Winters in warmer climates, when there are no frosts and mild winters, cause the timing to be different. During the fall, sow seed directly into the ground to grow your artichoke as a short-lived perennial. A healthy flower head is dependent on when seeds are planted. Thus, planting in February might be fruitful. It takes a very long growing season for them to develop into large bushy plants. During the vernalization phase, artichokes must be exposed to temperatures below 10 degrees Celcius for at least two weeks. Yet, they are very frost-sensitive.<br></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HOW TO CARE ARTICHOKES AFTER SPROUTING</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As soon as the seedlings have sprouted, water them with a weak fertilizer solution every other week, but don't water them too much so as not to saturate the soil. These plants are heavy feeders! Once a seedling has sprouted, remove the smallest and weakest ones and leave only one per pot. It will make one plant sure to harvest. The seedlings you grow indoors should be between 8 and 10 inches. Harden them off, then plant them outdoors. The plants should be planted 45 - 60 cm apart. You should take good care of them apart from each other and enjoy the results of your labour. Protect the plant from winter temperatures by mulching it with straw in autumn.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Specifications:</strong><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Season:</strong> March</li>\n<li>\n<strong>USDA Zones:</strong> 7-11</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Days to Harvest:</strong> 180 days.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Height:</strong> 3 Feet</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Bloom Season:</strong> Winter</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Soil Type:</strong> Loam</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Temperature:</strong> 10 Degrees Celcius</li>\n<li>\n<b>Kingdom: </b>Plantae </li>\n<li>\n<b>Clade:</b> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids </li>\n<li>\n<b>Order:</b> Asterales </li>\n<li>\n<b>Family: </b>Asteraceae<b> </b>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Genus:</b> Cynara </li>\n<li>\n<b>Species: </b>C. cardunculus </li>\n<li>\n<b>Variety: </b>C. c. var. scolymus</li>\n<li>\n<b>Usage: </b>Medicine Vegetable</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Soak the seeds in warm water for 24-48 hours. This will soften the seed coat and make it easier for the seedling to emerge. Fill a seed tray or small pots with a well-draining potting mix. Moisten the soil with water, but avoid making it too wet, as this can lead to fungal growth. Place one or two seeds in each pot and cover them with a thin layer of soil. The seeds should be planted about 1-2 centimeters deep. Place the seed tray or pots in a warm, humid location, such as a greenhouse or a warm, sheltered spot indoors. Keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. Germination can take anywhere from 1-3 months, depending on the temperature and humidity levels. Be patient and avoid disturbing the seeds or soil during this time.</span></p>\n<h2><b>CARE FOR BAMBUSA TULDA PLANT AFTER GERMINATION</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the seedlings have grown to about 10-15 centimeters tall, they can be transplanted into larger pots or into the ground. Be sure to choose a location with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Bambusa tulda prefers consistently moist soil, but it is important to avoid overwatering, which can cause root rot. Apply a balanced fertilizer every 2-3 months during the growing season to provide essential nutrients for healthy growth. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch the leaves. This plant prefers warm and humid conditions, so it is best to keep it in a location with temperatures between 18-27°C and high humidity levels. Remove any dead or damaged leaves as soon as possible to promote healthy growth. </span></p>\n<h2>\n<b>USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF BAMBUSA TULDA</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>\n</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strong and durable timber of Bambusa tulda is widely used in construction, furniture-making, and other structural applications. The flexible and sturdy culms of the plant are used to make a variety of crafts, including baskets, mats, and musical instruments. The beautiful and fast-growing plant is also grown for ornamental purposes in gardens and parks. The tender shoots of Bambusa tulda are edible and are used in many traditional dishes. Some studies suggest that the plant may have antioxidant properties that can help protect against oxidative stress and cell damage. The plant contains dietary fiber, which can promote digestive health and regularity. </span></p>\n<p><b><i>Note:</i></b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></i></p>\n<h3><b>Specifications:</b></h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common Name: Timber bamboo</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scientific Name: Bambusa tulda</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Season: Year-round</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feature: Tall and sturdy culms</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use: Construction, crafts, food, ornamental</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More: Potential health benefits</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kingdom: Plantae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clade: Tracheophytes</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Order: Poales</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family: Poaceae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subfamily: Bambusoideae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genus: Bambusa</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-7 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.</p>\n</div>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Plant the pits in a container of moist potting soil, about 2-3 inches deep. The soil pH should be between 6.0-7.0. Place the container in a plastic bag or cover it with plastic wrap to retain moisture. Keep the container in a warm, sunny location and check the soil moisture regularly. The cherry pits may take several months to germinate, so patience is key.

Water the tree regularly, especially during dry spells, to ensure the soil stays moist but not waterlogged. Cherry trees also benefit from regular fertilization to promote healthy growth and fruit production. Use a balanced fertilizer in early spring and mid-summer, according to the instructions on the package. Prune the tree in late winter or early spring to remove any dead or damaged branches, and to shape the tree for better fruit production. Protect the tree from pests and diseases by keeping the area around the tree clean and free of debris, and by using organic pest control methods if necessary.</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">BENEFITS OF HAVING A </b><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">CHERRIE</b><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> TREE</b>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cherry trees offer a delightful combination of culinary versatility and aesthetic appeal.

Punch drainage holes in the bottom of some drinking cups about three inches tall. Then fill them with soil. The seeds will be hard, brown, and bean-like. You will get healthy seeds from Garden Paradise Seeds easily. Put the seeds in a bowl and submerge them in boiling water. The seeds should be left overnight to scarify and improve germination. You should plant one seed approximately one inch deep in each cup after the seeds have been freshly treated. Place the seed in the soil mixture and lightly water it.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To encourage germination, warm places are needed. Do not let the soil become wet. Two to three weeks after germination, look for signs of growth on the silk tree seeds. Transplant each seedling into a larger pot once it has three to four leaves. They can even tolerate a short period of drought if they are kept moist with just the right amount of water. Covering the tree with two inches of mulch will protect it from the weather and moisten the soil. Your tree does not need to be watered if you're getting regular rainfall. Silk trees can grow in various soil types and tolerate drought.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF SILK TREE</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Albizia julibrissin, also known as the silk tree, makes an elegant addition to any garden. A herb initially cultivated in the tropics, albizia can be found in the eastern and southern hemispheres. It is used to make medicine from its flowers and stem bark. It is used by mouth to treat anxiety, cancer, depression, sleep problems (insomnia), sore throats, and reduce swelling associated with trauma. In Chinese medicine, the bark of the Mimosa tree is also commonly prescribed. As a spiritual cleanser, it is suitable for treating depression and irritability, and insomnia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">﻿Persian </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Silk tree seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Late spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">6-9</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 7 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Well-drained</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 70 degrees Fahrenheit</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fabales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fabaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subfamily: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Caesalpinioideae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mimosoid clade</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Albizia</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Julibrissin</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Female or male seeds will germinate. When there are no plants available, ordering seeds from a reputable seed supplier like Garden Paradise Seeds will ensure that the seeds will germinate. It may take a few months for the seeds to germinate. Put the seeds from the sago palm into a shallow seed starting container or tray while wearing gloves. Before planting, all outer husks should have been removed from the sago palm seeds. You can do this by soaking them in water beforehand. Arrange the sago palm seeds horizontally in the tray. Top with sandy seed starting mix. Maintain a warm, moist environment throughout the sago palm seed germination process. Ensure that the tray remains moist during the germination process for sago palm seeds.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR SAGO PALM AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Although Sago palm seeds germinate very slowly, they still provide a reliable way to propagate new trees. Slender and low-maintenance sago palms (Cycas revoluta) thrive in zones 9b to 12a, where their fronds and palm-like shape add a tropical touch to landscaping. While acclimatizing to outdoor conditions, sago palms require light shade and shelter from strong winds. Put them against a south- or west-facing wall where the temperature stays warm at night. It's essential to let the soil dry out before watering young sago palms, as too much moisture can cause significant root problems. Before transplanting a seedling into the garden, let it grow under nursery conditions for a week or so.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF SAGO PALM</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In the textile industry, sago palms are used to stiffen cloth material and various food products. Sago starch can be dehydrated and stored for exceptionally long periods. There are many uses for this starch. Sago pearls are made from this starch. There are some places where it is a primary source of carbohydrates. Sago contains antioxidants and resistant starch linked to many health benefits, including improved heart health and enhanced exercise performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sago Palm Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Autumn</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 9-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 60-90 days.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Sandy soil</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 20-25 Degrees Celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Cycas revoluta</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Division: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cycadophyta</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Higher classification: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cycas</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Conservation status:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Least Concern (Population stable) Encyclopedia of Life</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Cycadales</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Information:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ireland u0026amp; Northern Ireland: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Orders placed before 4 p.m. will be delivered the next day, otherwise usually two working days. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From 2,00 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rest of the World:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-11 Working Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From 2,90 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">- Except for Australia u0026amp; New Zealand,</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> shipping costs are 3.50 Euros.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at<span> </span></span><b>Garden Paradise Seeds</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are dedicated to providing the best quality products with the best customer service in the entire market.

You can grow them from seeds or cuttings. You need light for the seed to germinate, but once it sprouts, it proliferates. Plant them in prepared seedbeds outside after all danger of frost. Sprinkle the seed on the soil surface and mist the bed with water to moisten it. Germination should occur in about two weeks with moist soil. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF PENNYROYAL</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As long as they receive adequate moisture, pennyroyal plants grow best in partial sunlight. However, full sun is also tolerated. Make sure the plant gets at least six hours of daylight each day. Rich, moist soil that has been amended with organic matter is ideal for their growth. That being said, the plant can also grow in clay or sandy conditions. Make sure to water it regularly for best results.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PENNYROYAL USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Pennyroyal is used to stimulate and deal with weaknesses for some people.

The best results will come with slightly acidic soil. Plant tomato seeds in March or April, approximately six to eight weeks before the last frost of the winter, or earlier if you're growing your tomatoes in a greenhouse. Sow the seeds thinly onto good-quality seed compost. Use a fine rose watering can and water lightly after covering it with 1.5mm of compost. Wait until they have grown four to 10-15 cm. tall and the danger of frost is gone before planting outside. <br><br></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PEAR TOMATO </span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Give your plants plenty of space, about one meter between each. Please keep them in a sunny spot. During the summer, you should water them regularly and fertilize them a couple of times. Apply mulch to help keep the soil moist. Yellow pear tomato plants are indeterminate, meaning they can grow up to 2.5 m in height. You should make sure you prepare some support for your plants so they don't lie on the ground where they could rot or be more susceptible to pests. Around 70 to 80 days after you start your plants, you should pick ripe fruits.</span></p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PEAR TOMATO </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fresh tomatoes are best, so be prepared to eat them right after you harvest them. Salads, party vegetable trays, or a snack right off the vine are great ways to use tomatoes. Moreover, yellow pear tomatoes contain vitamin C, niacin, folate, and potassium, which regulate blood pressure, nerve function, and muscle control. The best tomatoes require sun, well-draining soil, and nutrients. Before planting tomatoes, amend the soil with compost or organic matter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Yellow Pear Tomato Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plant Length: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">6-10 Feet</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fast Growing</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fertile, Moist</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Harvest Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">70-80 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fertilizer:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Yes</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific Name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Solanum Lycopersicum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">D.

It is easiest to grow from plants, but you can also sow seeds once the ground warms up in the spring. Seeds should be sticky until they germinate, and plants should be spaced 1 foot apart. Spearmint takes off quickly once planted, and it can also take over quickly. To avoid pulling out spearmint runners constantly, some gardeners grow the plants in hanging baskets or containers. You can also plant spearmint in a five-gallon pot with the bottom cut out if you want to grow it in the garden. Your spearmint plants will not be able to invade other areas of the garden due to the runners. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR SPEARMINT SEEDS AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Taking care of spearmint is similar to taking care of most mints. Spearmint can be very easily taken care of. The roots of mint plants need to be kept cool and moist by mulching annually. It is best to fertilize potting mint with a liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season. Make sure you divide your plants every two years to keep them healthy. Regularly prune your potted plants to make them look healthy and attractive. You should place potted spearmint in a sunny window if your area has very cold winters.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF SPEARMINT</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">With its refreshing taste, spearmint can help keep your mouth feeling clean. In addition, it has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, which can improve dental health. In addition, chewing helps clean the teeth and mouth as well. The oil and leaves are used as medicines. A variety of digestive disorders can be treated with spearmints, such as gas, indigestion, nausea, diarrhea, upper gastrointestinal tract spasms, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), bile duct, and gallbladder swelling (inflammation), and gallstones.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spearmint Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 4a-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 60 days.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Slightly Acidic</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 13-21 Degrees Celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mentha spicata</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Higher classification: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mint</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lamiales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lamiaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mentha</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Beneficial Herb</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Information:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ireland u0026amp; Northern Ireland: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Orders placed before 4 p.m. will be delivered the next day, otherwise usually two working days. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From 2,00 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rest of the World:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-11 Working Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From 2,90 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">- Except for Australia u0026amp; New Zealand,</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> shipping costs are 3.50 Euros. </span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at<span> </span></span><b>Garden Paradise Seeds</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are dedicated to providing the best quality products with the best customer service in the entire market.

Before you plant:</span></p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ensure the soil is rich in organic matter, such as compost or aged animal manure. You may also need to lighten the planting hole with an organic fertilizer application.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sow seeds indoors just beneath the soil's surface 8-10 weeks before the last frost.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Germinate at 15-20°C.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After a week or ten days, the seeds should germinate. Once the last frost has passed, transplant the plants out the following spring.

Allow the soil to dry out between waterings completely, and then soak the soil entirely through. Hyssop plants can be trimmed to maintain a neat shape without pruning in the growing season. Cut the plants back completely during early spring. A plant will be more compact and flower better in the following year when its leaves are pruned to the first set after flowering. So it's your choice whether to prune or not.</p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HOW TO HARVEST AND STORE </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HYSSOP BLUE</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p>The aromatic plant with small leaves and blue flowers. It is 55cm high, has a bitter taste, and is in your garden. If you need young leaves or stems, harvest them as needed. The optimal flavor is achieved when the dew has dried in the morning. Leaves should not be washed, or the aromatic oils will be lost. Hyssop is best used fresh but can also be frozen or dried and stored in plastic bags. In a well-ventilated, dark room, hang the cuttings upside down in small bundles until they are dry. Leaves should be separated from stems and stored whole when dry. Before use, crush, or grind.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sowing Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 4 - 9</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Water Tolerance:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Low-Water</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mature Height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 30-60cm tall</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloom Time:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 20 degrees Celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Lamiales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Lamiaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Hyssopus </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> H.

This idea will help prevent root rot. For starting, pour some citrus compost into the pot with pointed seeds. Make sure you moisten the soil, then sow the seeds half an inch deep.

Generally, January is an excellent time to start hot pepper seeds, but you may want to start as early as November or as late as February. Place seed-starting mix in a tray filled with cells. Afterwards, water the trays well and drain until the mixture is moist but not soggy—place seeds on top of the damp seed starting mix. The tray should be covered with clear plastic or placed inside a white garbage bag. Watch for seeds to germinate, which can take as little as a week or as much as six weeks, depending on temperature and variety. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR HOT PETER PEPPER AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Once the seeds have germinated, remove the plastic. Use fluorescent bulbs or grow lights to illuminate the trays. Peter Pepper Plants require at least six hours of direct sunlight each day. The strongest, sturdiest seeds in each cell should be left. Make use of scissors to cut away the weakest seedlings. The seedlings will grow more vital if you place a fan near them. If the air isn't too cold, you can also open a window. When the seedlings are big enough to handle, transplant them into three- to four-inch pots filled with regular potting soil. Ensure that the days and nights are warm and there is no frost.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF HOT PETER PEPPER</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The peter pepper can be as hot as a serrano pepper, so they're suitable for making sauces and hot sauces. They're also good for spicy sauces. Besides using them for salsa recipes, you can also use them in everyday cooking as part of your mirepoix or Cajun Holy Trinity for soups, stews, gumbos, and more. Researchers have found that capsaicin can improve heart health, prevent diabetes, and to avoid cancer. These peppers can also make you feel less hungry and lower your blood pressure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #219e4f;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Peter Pepper Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> April, May</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">3</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 60-80 Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Loamy</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">20-25° Degrees C</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Capsicum annuum 'Peter pepper.'</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Higher classification: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sweet And chilli pepper</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rank: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cultivar</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Beneficial Chili </span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul></ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Plants with delicate taproots, such as parsley, should be handled with extra care when transplanting. Plant the seeds in individual pots indoors 8 to 10 weeks before the last spring frost date. In the spring, sow parsley seeds outdoors 3 to 4 weeks before the last spring frost. The germination rate of parsley seeds tends to be low, so consider soaking the seeds overnight to improve your chances of success. The best soil temperature for parsley seed germination is 21°C, although seeds will germinate at colder temperatures, too.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF  PARSLEY</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Well-draining soil with a high concentration of organic matter is ideal for growing parsley. Pick a spot that gets full sun (6 to 8 hours of sunlight). The parsley will sprout in approximately three weeks if you choose a weed-free area. You can plant radish seeds in the gaps between parsley seeds. Sprouting and growth of radishes will precede the appearance of parsley, and radishes will mark the row. Maintain sufficient moisture in parsley plants throughout the summer, especially when it's hot. Use a light mulch around the plants to conserve water.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> PARSLEY USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Herbs like parsley are used in medicine for their leaves, seeds, and roots. Parsley can be taken by mouth for bladder infections, kidney stones, gastrointestinal disorders, constipation, diabetes, cough, asthma, and high blood pressure. Parsley is rich in vitamin C and other antioxidants, which help reduce the risk of severe health conditions like diabetes, stroke, heart disease, and cancer. This herb is also rich in vitamin A and folate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Parsley</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Petroselinum crispum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Planting Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spring </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sunlight Requirement: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Full Sun </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moist</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Apiales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Apiaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Petroselinum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> P. crispum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Salad, Vegetables</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

      "description": "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HOW TO SOW KOHLRABI FROM SEEDS</span></strong></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kohlrabi seeds can be started from seeds quickly. The Kohlrabi seeds should be started in the early spring or the early fall. It would be best not to begin Kohlrabi from seeds until the soil temperature reaches at least 7 degrees C. Seed propagation requires fertile soil. When starting Kohlrabi from seeds, plant the seeds about 0.5 cm. deep in rows two feet apart. A row of seedlings should be thinned to 10 to 15 cm apart after 4-7 days from when they emerge. Much like spinach or mustard greens, the tender young leaves of the plants can be eaten.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF KOHLRABI</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Maintain an even moisture level in the soil to promote rapid growth. Without water, Kohlrabi will become woody. Use aged compost to prepare planting beds—side-dress Kohlrabi with aged compost once a month. A plant-starter or balanced organic fertilizer can also feed Kohlrabi once a month. Cultivate carefully to avoid harming the shallow roots. Mulch the kohlrabi plants when they reach a height of 10-12 cm with aged compost. Cutworms, cabbage loopers, and imported cabbage worms can attack Kohlrabi. Protect seedling stems from cutworm damage by wrapping collars around them. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">KOHLRABI USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kohlrabi is just a superfood. These cruciferous vegetables are cousins to brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, and kale and are rich in nutrients. To be a superfood, the item must be nutrient-rich, which Kohlrabi is. In addition to being nutrient-rich, it is also low in calories. It is used as an antioxidant for cancer, heart disease, constipation, diabetes, gout, hemorrhoids, hot flashes, high cholesterol, liver disease, menstrual symptoms, sciatica pain, scurvy, and weight loss. It is also applied to the skin for hair loss. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #12834b;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #12834b;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product type: </span></strong>Kohlrabi<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Seed</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zone: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">5 Above</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fast Growing</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fertile</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Harvest Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">50-70 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Brassica oleracea Gongylodes Group</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Higher classification: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Wild cabbage</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rank: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cultivar group</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plant Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Brassicaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Beneficial Vegetable</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost <span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">from</span>: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

The soil should be well-draining and of medium quality. During the growing season, Rue can be propagated via cuttings and also from seeds. You can start your Rue seeds indoors 3 to 4 weeks before the last spring frost by planting them under lights or in a sunny window. After the previous frost threat has passed, direct-sow or transplant seedlings outside. It is best to make soil from aged compost and a few handfuls of sand. Despite Rue's light feeding habits, compost or an all-purpose fertilizer will assist it in getting started.<br><br></span></div>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR GERMINATION OF </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">RUE RUTA</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When it comes to triggering germination, 68°F is the sweet spot. In most cases, germination takes place in seven to twenty days. Seeds should be kept moist until they germinate, and seedlings and transplants should also be kept moist until they've developed roots. Watering Rue plants at the bottom or with intermittent drip irrigation is best. After the indoor seedlings reach a size where they can be handled, transplant them into pots and grow them. After the last frost is expected, plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. It will be ideal if the place is in full sun, with fertile soil that is not too wet. Allow 30 cm between objects.</span></p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">RUE RUTA</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is important to water regularly but does not drown the soil. It requires little maintenance to grow Rue. It can be pruned back to just above its woody base in spring or fall after it has finished flowering. It would help if you deadheaded rue blooms since they reseed themselves. The trimmed bases of rue plants need to be mulched in areas where it is colder in winter to keep it from freezing. The yellow flowers of this evergreen bush are highly aromatic. Leafy greens can be added to sandwiches and salads when finely chopped. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sowing Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 60-90cm</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Germination:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 10-14 Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloom Time:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 60-70 degrees F</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">More:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Reproductive</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Angiosperms, Eudicots, Rosids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Sapindales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rutaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ruta</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">R. graveolens</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\" data-mce-style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries:</strong> 3-7 working days. <br>Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world:</strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br>Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.</p>\n</div>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></span><br>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Beets like soil with a pH of between 6.5 to 7. Before planting, apply a fertilizer containing both nitrogen and phosphorus. You should remove all large rocks and clods from the area since they can interfere with the growth of beetroots. Ensure the soil temps for beet germination are between 50-86 F. Seed thinly, 1.25 cm deep, 2 to 3 inches apart. In rows a foot apart. Seeds should be lightly covered with soil and sprayed with water. Similarly, Boltardy Beets can be sown from mid-March to July or under glass in January and February for a May crop.</span></div>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></strong><br>\n</h2>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HOW TO TAKE CARE OF GOLDEN BEETROOT</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When the seedlings are 1 to 2 inches tall, thinning should commence. By cutting the plants that appear weakest and smallest, instead of pulling them, you may avoid disturbing neighbouring seedling roots. Thinning is essential to allow the developing plant room to grow. Beet seeds do not consist of a single seed. It is a cluster of seeds in dried fruit, so multiple seedlings will likely come up from a single seed. Maintain the moisture of golden beet plants. You should water deeply and keep the soil moist. By mulching established plants with a 1 to 2-inch layer, this can be achieved. You should keep the area weed-free and use foliar seaweed-based fertilizer once or twice a week. Apply a balanced organic fertilizer mid-growing season.</span></p>\n<h2>\n<b>KNOW ABOUT </b><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">GOLDEN BEETROOT</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An attractive globe-shaped red beet that has orange-yellow roots that turn golden yellow when cooked.

The seeds you buy from Garden Paradise Seeds are perfect for growing healthy eggplants. Plant seeds in seed flats six to eight weeks before they are planted outside. Plant eggplant seeds 1 - 4 inches deep. Ideally, seeds germinate at a temperature of 75 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. A seed heating pad can regulate the soil temperature. Eggplant seeds take seven to 14 days to germinate. Keeping the soil damp but not too wet is crucial for ensuring the survival of seeds and seedlings. It will be easier to grow if you space the plants 18 to 24 inches apart when transplanting them into the garden bed.<br><br></span></div>\n<h2><b>CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF IVORY EGGPLANT</b></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Growing healthy Aubergines requires full sun, six hours a day, and consistent moisture. Keep the soil moist with deep, slow waterings weekly or more often during dry weather. In hot weather, add more water to the soil if it feels dry. Eggplant plants need roughly one inch of water per week. If you amended the soil before planting, you wouldn't need to give your eggplants additional fertilizer. As soon as weed seedlings appear, remove them by hand or using a hoe or shallow weeder. Because they have shallow roots, you shouldn't dig deeply so as not to damage them. White eggplants are ready to harvest when they are between 2 and 6 inches.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">WHY SHOULD YOU GROW IVORY EGGPLANT SEEDS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Aubergines have a lot of health benefits. They are rich in fiber and antioxidants. Fiber, copper, manganese, B-6, and thiamine are all found in aubergines at least 5% of the daily recommended intake. It also contains other vitamins and minerals. Furthermore, eggplants contain antioxidant compounds called phenolics. Free radicals are molecules that damage cells if they accumulate in large amounts, and antioxidants help the body eliminate them. Foods that contain antioxidants may help prevent a range of diseases. Anthocyanins in eggplants include nasunin, lutein, and zeaxanthin. Therefore, you should have this plant in your garden.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\">Note</span>:</span></em></strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Any</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 5-12</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 80 days.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 24-36 inches</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Loam</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 20 Degrees Celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Solanales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Solanaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Solanum </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">S. melongena</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Recipes: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">grilled, stuffed, roasted, served in soups</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Information:</span></strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ireland u0026amp; Northern Ireland:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Orders placed before 4 p.m. will be delivered the next day, otherwise usually two working days. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> From 2,00 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rest of the World :</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-11 Working Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From 2,90 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">- Except</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> for Australia u0026amp; New Zealand, shipping costs are from 3.50 Euros.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at </span><b>Garden Paradise Seeds</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are dedicated to providing the best quality products with the best customer service in the entire market.

Those plants that are strong enough to handle are thinned out. It will start germination in 14 - 20 days.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">ASPARAGUS</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Growing Asparagus can take three years after its seed is sown. One-year-old crowns need two years of growth before they can be harvested, and those that are two years old need only one year. Be patient in the first year of cutting by limiting spear harvesting to 10 days. Asparagus will then build strength and reward you with higher yields after that. Cutting is allowed for two weeks during the second year. In the following weeks, harvesting can last six weeks. Stop cutting when spears start to get thinner. Make sure they are not lighter than a pencil. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">WHY SHOULD YOU GROW ASPARAGUS SEEDS</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asparagus, which is sometimes called asparagus officinalis, belongs to the lily family. Green, white, and purple varieties are available for this popular vegetable. Providing 6% of your daily potassium needs with a half-cup serving of Asparagus is a good source of potassium. It’s used in dishes around the world, including frittatas, pasta, and stir-fries. In addition, Asparagus contains a lot of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\">Note</span>:</span></em></strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>\n<strong>Product:</strong> F1 Portlim Asparagus Seeds</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> February to June</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3 - 8</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 1-2 years</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 6-10 inches</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloom Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fertile</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Monocots </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Asparagales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asparagaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subfamily: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asparagaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asparagus </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: A. </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Officinalis</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-7 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.</p>\n</div>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

It is best to plant Musk Pumpkin in elevated piles of soil. Doing so allows for good drainage and helps keep the soil and seeds warm. Hilly soil warms more quickly than soil at a base level. The seeds will sprout when the soil temperature is 18 degrees Celsius, but the optimal soil temperature is 23 degrees Celsius. So avoid planting seeds too early, especially if it is a wetter spring than usual, as seeds will rot in cold soil. The hills should have 12 inches and should be spaced 6 feet apart. Each hill should contain five to six seeds pointing downward, buried one inch deep—delicate plants to three or four when they germinate. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR MUSK PUMPKIN SEEDS AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Seedlings should be thinned by cutting them with scissors. The roots of the remaining seedlings will be disturbed if the seedlings are pulled from the ground. Root disturbances make them very sensitive. Once you have transplanted your seedlings that you started indoors or your direct-sown seeds have germinated, the vines will need at least one inch of water per week. Be sure to the water near the roots. The long handle of a watering wand is ideal. It's essential to keep your garden weeded so that pumpkins won't compete for water and nutrients. Mulching the soil with 2 to 3 inches of mulch will keep it moist and prevent weed seeds from germinating. Mulch shouldn't touch vines when added to your pumpkin patch. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF MUSK PUMPKIN</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is one of the many benefits of growing your pumpkins instead of buying canned pumpkins from the grocery store to eat every part of the plant. The flowers, leaves, stems, seeds, and flesh of pumpkins (including pumpkin skin) are all edible! It is a good source of vitamin C and beta-carotene. Moreover, pumpkins contain lutein and zeaxanthin, which may help prevent cataracts and reduce the risk of macular degeneration.</span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"color: #02a64e;\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><i data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Note:</i></b></span><i data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></i></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Specifications:</b></p>\n<ul data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Product:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Musk Pumpkin Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Season:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Summer</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">USDA Zones:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 7b</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Days to Harvest:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 100-110 days.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Soil Type:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Well-drained</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Temperature:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 16 Degrees Celcius (At least)</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Kingdom: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Scientific name: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cucurbita pepo</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Order: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cucurbitales</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Higher classification: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cucurbitaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Uses: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vegetable Seeds</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Start seeds grown indoors four to six weeks before the last frost in your area—plant seeds just barely below the surface of the soilless mix. Place the seeds on a heating mat with set temperatures between 18-24 C. Keep the seedlings moist and expose them to direct sunlight or artificial light for 16 hours per day. This cabbage will germinate within 7-12 days. They are replanting when the seedlings have their first true leaves and a week before the final frost. Plants should be refrigerated or in a greenhouse a week before planting.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF RED CABBAGE</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Transplant in a sunny location with well-draining, compost-rich soil after a week. When growing Red Express, remember that the heads are compact and can be spaced closer together than in other varieties. Space plants 38-46 cm. Away from one another, with rows 61-92 cm apart. Fertilize the plants with fish or seaweed emulsion as well as well-amended soil. Cabbage is a heavy feeder. Also, when growing Red Express cabbage, keep the beds consistently moist. Acidic soil may not work well for them, so lime should be added to the soil. If dry weather occurs, water the plants thoroughly before transplanting them.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">RED CABBAGE USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In most recipes, you can interchangeably use red or green cabbage, but red cabbage requires an additional step. Anthocyanins, which give red cabbage its colour, are water-soluble and turn an unappetizing blue colour when cooked. Besides providing vitamin K, red cabbage also contains calcium, magnesium, and zinc.

Spring is the time to sow your seeds in pots or modules. Seeds should be covered with vermiculite. Plant them outdoors when they've grown large enough. Sage will grow in sandy loam, but average soil is also suitable. The pH of the soil should be between 6.0 and 6.7 for Sage to thrive. Sage seeds can be started indoors six to eight weeks before the last frost date. The seeds should be planted in the garden in late spring, about one month after the last frost. Seeds should be sown shallowly. The seeds of sage should be planted 1 cm deep. Sage seedlings or transplants should be spaced no more than 50cm apart. Keep rows at least 50 cm apart.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></strong></h2>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF SAGE PAINTED</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is usually necessary to water Sage regularly until it becomes established. As soon as you have established the sage, keep it dry. The soil should not be soggy as sage is easily harmed by wet soil. Lack of moisture can benefit sage, but it should not wilt if sufficient humidity isn't provided. Mildew problems can be caused by overhead watering. Sand-loam soils are ideal for growing sage, but it does not need to be fertilized. The second time in the growing season, sprinkle the sage with compost tea. Sage can be mulched with compost or chopped leaves in very hot regions. In addition to slowing soil evaporation, weed growth is prevented.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">WHAT IS SAGE PAINTED ?</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Since it has small white, pink, or purple flowers surrounded by long green bracts, Clary sage is also known as Annual Bluebeard Sage, Joseph Sage, or Painted Sage. These beautiful flowers are best seen in the summer when many bees and insects are attracted to them. As an annual herb plant, Salvia Viridis grows as painted sage. S. In addition to its use as a garden plant, harmonium's leaves and flowers are edible. Very decorative plant. Leaves and seeds are used to assist the fermentation of liquor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Product: </strong>Sage Painted Seeds</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sowing Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 60cm</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 12-24 Months</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloom Time:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 15 degrees C</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Use:  </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">aiding digestion, combating diarrhea,</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">More:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Reproductive</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Lamiales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Lamiaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Salvia</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: S.

Starting seeds indoors is best between late February and mid-summer. Fill a 7, 5 cm pot with seed compost, firm down, and sow basil Gustosa seeds over the top. Only a few more seeds than needed will germinate, so plant just a few more. Wrap the plant in vermiculite, water gently, then pop it into a propagator. If you don't have one, don't worry. A clear, small freezer bag can be used to cover the pot, and an elastic band can be used to secure it. Germination usually takes between 10 days to 2 weeks at 15-18C.<br><br></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF  BASIL GUSTOSA</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Since the plants are easily growable, there is little need to worry about them. Plant basil gustosa outside after all frost danger has passed, choose a sunny, sheltered spot with well-drained soil, or grow plants in containers. Every time roots start showing through holes in the bottom of a pot, move it into a slightly bigger container to keep the plant going until the pot is 20cm in diameter. Prune the branches of your plants regularly to keep them bushy and productive, and remove any flowers that begin to appear. That's all you have to do.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">WHAT IS BASIL GUSTOSA?</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In addition to their use in cooking, the leaves of Basil Gustosa can also be consumed raw. Holy basil tastes spicy and bitter. A great source of vitamin A, vitamin C, manganese, iron, and vitamin K, basil possesses these compounds in abundance. It's also a good source of calcium, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids. Basil Gustosa isn't limited to internal use. Oil extracted from basil's leaves is used in treating infections, wounds, and cuts. Additionally, it is proven to have anti-acne properties. Overall, Basil Gustosa is very versatile in its use.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Simmer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 10-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 60 Days.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 12-24 inches</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Moist</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 15-18 degree celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Lamiales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lamiaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ocimum </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">O. basilicum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Beneficial Herb</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\" data-mce-style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Prepare a well-draining potting mix with equal parts of peat moss, sand, and perlite. Sow the seeds 1 inch deep in the potting mix. Water the soil gently to avoid washing away the seeds and place the pot in a warm, bright spot with temperatures around 70-85°F (21-29°C). Keep the soil moist, but not soggy. Germination can take 1-3 months, so be patient and maintain a consistent temperature and moisture level.</span></p>\n<h2><b>CARE FOR FLAMBOYANT PLANTS AFTER GERMINATION</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flamboyant trees require full sun, so place them in a location with direct sunlight for at least 6-8 hours a day. Water the young plant regularly but avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot. Allow the topsoil to dry out slightly before watering again. After the plant has established itself, fertilize it once a month during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer. Prune the tree in the early stages of growth to shape it into a single trunk. Later on, remove any dead or diseased branches and trim back any branches that are growing too close to each other. Once the plant has outgrown its pot, transplant it into a larger container or in the ground outside. Choose a location with well-draining soil and ample space for the tree to grow. </span></p>\n<h2><b>USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF FLAMBOYANT TREE</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Flamboyant Tree is primarily grown as an ornamental tree for its striking, red-orange flowers and attractive, fern-like leaves. It is often planted along streets and in parks and gardens. The bark, leaves, and seeds of the Flamboyant Tree have been used in traditional medicine to treat a range of health conditions, including fever, diarrhea, inflammation, and respiratory problems. The Flamboyant Tree contains high levels of antioxidants, which can help protect the body against oxidative stress and inflammation. The Flamboyant Tree has been used topically to treat wounds, cuts, and burns. The leaves are boiled and used as a poultice to treat skin infections and inflammation.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>Note:</i></b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></i></p>\n<h3><b>Specifications:</b></h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common Name: Flamboyant Tree</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scientific Name: Delonix regia</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Season: Summer</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feature: Red-orange flowers, fern-like leaves</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use: Ornamental, medicinal</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More: Native to Madagascar, attracts birds and butterflies</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kingdom: Plantae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clade: Angiosperms</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Order: Fabales</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family: Fabaceae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subfamily: Caesalpinioideae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genus: Delonix</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Also, it's essential to realize that apples are susceptible to many diseases and pests. Therefore, this fruit is rarely grown without pesticides. Most apples need pollen from another apple tree to produce fruit. This is called cross-pollination.

As zinnias are frost-sensitive, don't seed them until after the last frost. See your local frost dates. The flowering period can be extended by sowing seeds every week for several weeks.  A location that receives full sun is essential. Later in the season, good air circulation can help prevent foliar diseases such as powdery mildew. In terms of soil conditions, zinnias are adaptable to many, but the ideal soil will be well-drained and rich in organic matter. Sow zinnia seeds are only about one cm deep. </span></div>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></b></h2>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">CARE FOR ZINNIA PLANTS AFTER GERMINATION</b></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zinnia seedlings will appear within a week for most varieties, but blooms may take up to several months, depending on the planting location and climate. To maximize air circulation, thin seedlings when they reach three inches tall so that they are six to 18 inches apart. By doing so, powdery mildew is less likely to develop. Water the soil moderately and fertilize lightly to maximize growth and bloom. You can encourage more blooms by cutting off the old flowers after zinnias flower. Zinnias are annuals and will die when the first hard frost occurs in the fall. </span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF ZINNIA</b></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zinnia flowers and leaves are used as medicinal and ritual herbs by many tribes in the Southwest. The zinnia is considered one of the sacred Life Medicines of the Navajo people. In more practical terms, zinnias were also used to make dyes and paints with bright colors. In their growing season, from May until October, nectar-rich zinnias attract bees and make wonderful pollinators. Hummingbirds, Japanese beetles, ladybugs, and wasps are attracted to them as well. For gardeners seeking easy-to-care-for flowers, zinnias are an excellent choice.</span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><i data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Note:</i></b></span><i data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></i></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Specifications:</b></p>\n<ul data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Product:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Red Zinnia Elegans Seed</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Season:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> June</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">USDA Zones:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  2-11</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Days to Harvest:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 60-70 days.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Soil Type:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rganic matter and well-drained</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Temperature:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 21-26 Degrees Celsius</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Kingdom: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Clade:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Order:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Asterales</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Family: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asteraceae</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Subfamily: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asteroidea</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Super Tribe: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helianthodae</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Genus: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zinnia</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Other than that, you can plant the seeds outside. Scarification speeds up the germination process for morning glory seeds, which are notoriously difficult to germinate. Once they have been rubbed between two pieces of coarse sandpaper for a few seconds, soak them overnight. The seeds should be planted about a quarter-inch deep and a few inches apart. After sprouting, it is imperative to maintain a moist environment.</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">CARE FOR DOUBLE RED MORNING GLORY AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morning Glory (Sunrise Serenade) plants thrive in moist but well-draining soil. In case the vines are not doing well, it is still possible to amend the soil. Water your morning glory plants about one inch a week, and mulch around the roots to keep them moist. You can reduce the watering schedule once the plant has established itself (and in the winter) so it uses less water as it grows. Despite its hardiness, early morning glory tolerates both cold and hot conditions.</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">USES AND BENEFITS OF DOUBLE RED MORNING GLORY</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morning Glory has been used as a diuretic and expectorant in Asian and Mesoamerican cultures for centuries.

Container planting also works well for these flowers. Approximately six inches of soil should be tilled six weeks before you plant by removing weeds and grass. If you would like to add more nutrients, consider adding compost. When the last frost has passed, scatter seeds over the garden. Plant seeds in pots indoors up to four to six weeks before the last frost of the season if you wish to start seeds earlier. It takes one to two weeks for seeds to germinate between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR AFRICAN MARIGOLDS AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Summer and autumn are the finest times to see African marigolds blooming because they can withstand heat and drought. While they will tolerate clay or dry soil, they prefer moist, well-draining soil. Maintain moist but not wet soil by watering regularly. After rain or watering, watch for puddles of water or squishy mud six hours after watering. This indicates the soil is not draining, and your flowers are at risk of drowning. Deadheading or removing a spent flower will prevent damage to the stems during the summer and early autumn and prolong blooming. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND BENEFITS OF AFRICAN MARIGOLD</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Externally, African marigolds can treat sores, ulcers, eczema, conjunctivitis, rheumatism, and sore eyes. A paste made from the leaves can be used to treat boils, carbuncles, and earaches externally. It is diuretic, carminative, and vermifuge. The decoction of this herb can be used to treat colds and mumps. Dried marigold flowers can be used to prepare tea. Adding a tablespoon of dried flowers to boiled water before steeping the tea can allow the petals to be dried at a low temperature and then dried at a low temperature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #03b41d;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> White African Marigold Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 2-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 4-6 weeks</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sandy or loamy soil</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">22 Degrees C</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific Name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tagetes erecta</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Asterales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Asteraceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subfamily: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asteroideae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tagetes</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

The best conditions for them are the full sun and warm temperatures. Shade-tolerant varieties, however, will produce fewer flowers. You should have loamy, well-draining soil. Sandy soil with dry roots will cause plant wilt, while clay soil with wet roots will cause root rot. Plant spacing should be between one and four feet, depending on the variety. Asters can be planted anytime during the growing season. Planting in the spring or fall will allow the plants to establish themselves before it becomes too hot or cold. The spring and early fall are the most suitable times to plant in the northern region. Before winter sets in, plants have time to grow roots.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR PURPLE ASTER FLOWER AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asters can reach heights of one to six feet and span a width of one to four feet, depending on the type and variety. Daisy-like flowers bloom on upright and bushy plants with hairy or smooth leaves. Midsummer is the time to stake or cage tall varieties of asters to prevent them from falling over in the fall. Water them thoroughly to prevent them from getting dehydrated. Keep them moist during the summer. Drought-stressed plants may have less impressive fall flowering. Planting asters infertile soils usually does not require much extra fertility. Every spring, add compost to the soil.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND BENEFITS OF ASTER </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The leaves and blooms of aster plants can be eaten. In the Ojibwa tradition, aster root was applied topically to treat headaches. The root was also used to treat venereal diseases. Due to its white color, aster root is associated with innocence. Asters' red color symbolizes devotion. They are pink in color and represent love and sensitivity. Toward the end of the season, goldenrods and asters attract various pollinating insects. Food and shelter are provided by the seeds and dried stalks by birds and small animals during the winter.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em><span style=\"color: #28b415;\">Note</span>:</em></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Purple Aster Flower Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Late spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-8</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 90-120</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Loamy soil</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">18°-21° degrees Celsius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific Name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Aster amellus</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asterales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asteraceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tribe: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Astereae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Aster</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Plant seeds in pots or flats in the winter and store them in the refrigerator for five to seven weeks to simulate winter dormancy. The colder weather stimulates germination. The best place to sow seeds in your home is a sunny spot where they will receive plenty of sunlight. Newly-planted plants should be planted outdoors once frost has passed. Based on the type and size of the plant, asters should be spaced one to three feet apart. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR BLUE ASTER WITH WHITE HEART AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Make sure plants receive plenty of water when they are planted. To prevent weeds and keep the soil cool, mulch the soil after planting. If you don't receive more than 1 inch of rain per week during the summer, water your tiny plants frequently. Despite this, many asters are moisture-sensitive; if they receive too much or too little moisture, their leaves will often drop off, or they will not bloom. Watch for stressed plants and change how you water them if your plants are losing flowers. Make sure tall varieties are supported so they won't fall over.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF BLUE ASTER </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Young leaves of the plant were boiled lightly and eaten as greens. The roots of the plant were used in soups. The Iroquois used a combination of aster, bloodroot, and other medicinal plants as laxatives in the past. Topically, aster root was used by the Ojibwa for headaches. Asters and goldenrods attract a lot of pollinating insects during the late season. During the winter, they provide shelter and food for birds and small animals that eat the seeds and seek refuge in the dried stalks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #01a30a;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #01a30a;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Blue Aster With White Heart Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Late spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 4-8</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Maturity</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 4-6 Weeks</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Loamy soil</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">18° - 21° degrees Celsius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific Name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Symphyotrichum ericoides</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asterales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asteraceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tribe: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Astereae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Aster</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> White Heart</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Use:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Beneficial Flower</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

They grow and bloom best in full sun. Shade-tolerant varieties will produce fewer flowers, however. You should have loamy soil with good drainage. Clay soil with wet roots will lead to root rot, and sandy soil with dry roots will lead to plant wilt. Spacing plants one to four feet apart depends on their variety. Aster flowers can be planted anytime during the growing season. A spring or fall planting will allow plants to get established before the weather gets too hot or too cold. If you live in the northern region, plant anytime between late spring and early fall. Roots will have a chance to grow before winter sets in.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR RED ASTER  AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Depending on the type and variety, asters grow from one to six feet tall and one to four feet wide. Plants with hairy or smooth leaves and daisy-like flowers are upright and bushy. Tall varieties of asters need to be staked or caged in midsummer to prevent them from falling over in the fall. Make sure they are well hydrated. If they get dry during the summer, water them. The fall flowering of drought-stressed plants may be less impressive. Asters usually do not require much extra fertility if planted in fertile soils. Apply compost in the spring every year.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND BENEFITS OF RED ASTER </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When eating aster plants, you can eat the blooms and the leaves. Aster root was applied topically by the Ojibwa to relieve headaches. It was also used to treat venereal diseases. Aster root symbolizes innocence due to its white hue. The red color of asters represents devotion. The pink color of asters symbolizes sensitivity and love. Late in the season, goldenrods and asters attract a wide variety of pollinating insects. During the winter, birds and small animals depend on the seeds and dried stalks for food and shelter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #02ae2b;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #02ae2b;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Red Aster Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Late spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-8</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 90-120</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Loamy soil</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">18°-21° degrees Celsius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific Name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Aster amellus</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asterales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asteraceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tribe: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Astereae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Aster</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Asters can have uneven germination when grown from seed. You can start growing seeds indoors by sowing seeds in pots or flats and holding them in the refrigerator for four to six weeks during the winter. It is during these colder weather conditions that seeds germinate. Seeds should be planted one inch deep in a sunny location in your home. After the danger of frost has passed, young plants should be grown outdoors. Depending on the type and size of the plant, you should space asters one to three feet apart. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR BLUE ASTER TALL AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Make sure plants have plenty of water when they are planted. To prevent weeds and keep the soil cool, mulch the soil after planting. Water your plants regularly if you receive less than an inch of rain per week during the summer. However, the majority of asters are moisture-sensitive, and if they get too much or too little moisture, they will often not flower or lose their lower leaves. Watch for stressed-out plants and try a different watering method if your plants are losing flowers. Encourage tall varieties to prevent them from falling over.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">BLUE ASTER TALL HEALTH BENEFITS AND USES</span></strong></h2>\n<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Blue Aster</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> is a plant that offers a range of health benefits and practical uses.

Some asters may have uneven germination when grown from seeds. Seeds can be grown indoors by sowing them in pots or flats and storing them in the refrigerator for four to six weeks during the winter. Germination occurs when the temperature is cooler. Plant your seeds at least one inch deep in a sunny location in your house. Young plants should be planted outdoors once the danger of frost has passed. Depending on their size and type, Aster plants should be spaced between one and three feet apart. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR RED ASTER AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When planting plants, make sure they have plenty of water. Mulch the soil after planting. It prevents weeds and keeps the soil cool. When it doesn't rain for more than an inch per week during the summer, water your plants regularly. In most cases, however, asters are moisture-sensitive, and if they get too much or too little moisture, they may not flower or lose their lower leaves. If your plants are losing flowers, keep an eye out for stressed plants and try a different watering method. To keep your plants from falling over, encourage tall varieties.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">RED ASTER FLOWER HEALTH BENEFITS AND USES</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Young leaves of the plant were boiled lightly and eaten as greens, as were the plant's roots. Historically, the Iroquois used aster, bloodroot, and other medicinal plants as laxatives. Aster root was applied topically to treat headaches by the Ojibwa. Goldenrods and asters attract many pollinating insects at the end of the growing season. During the winter, birds and small animals depend on them for food and shelter, eating seeds and hiding in dried stalks.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Note:</span></em></strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Red Aster Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Late spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 4-8</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Maturity</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 4-6 Weeks</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Loamy soil</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">18° - 21° degrees Celsius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific Name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Symphyotrichum ericoides</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asterales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asteraceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tribe: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Astereae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Aster</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Use:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Beneficial Flower</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

When temperatures are warm, aster plants should be placed not to be exposed to the midday sun. Please place them in a sunny location. Use loamy soil that is well-drained but not overly moist. Prepare the soil by mixing compost into it before planting. To simulate winter dormancy, start seeds indoors in pots or flats and store them in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 weeks. Cold weather increases germination during this period. It would be best to plant seeds an inch deep in your soil in a sunny spot in your home. In the spring, plant young plants outside when the risk of frost has passed. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR PINK ASTER TALL AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The best time to plant young asters is mid-to-late spring. As soon as they are available in your area, typically in the fall, you can plant fully-grown, potted asters. Depending on the type and size of the plant, aster plants should be spaced 1 to 3 feet apart. When planting, provide ample water for the plants. After planting, mulch the soil to keep it cool and prevent weed growth. Bees and butterflies are attracted to Asters because they attract pollinators. You should keep an eye out for stressed plants and try a different watering method to lose flowers.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF PINK ASTER TALL</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can eat the blooms and leaves fresh or dried when eating asters. To relieve headaches, the Ojibwa would apply aster root topically. They would also use aster flowers for venereal diseases. The white color of asters represents innocence. Asters are red, representing devotion. Asters are pink in color, representing sensitivity and love. The late-season attracts many pollinating insects to them, and many birds and small animals find food and shelter in the seeds and dried stalks during the winter season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #06b908;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #06b908;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Pink Aster Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Late spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 4-8</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Maturity</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 4-6 Weeks</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Loamy soil</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">18° - 21° degrees Celsius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific Name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Symphyotrichum ericoides</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asterales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asteraceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tribe: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Astereae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Aster</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Use:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Beneficial Flower</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Firm down the compost lightly by using a wood block or your hand. The seeds can be sown directly on the compost surface, one seed per cell if possible. Place a small pinch of seeds in each cell, cover with a centimeter-thick layer of compost or vermiculite, moisten with water, drain, and label. Alternatively, it can be covered with a plastic bag or placed in a heated propagator.

As a result, they prefer soil that isn't too rich because rich soil will promote foliage rather than blooms. It is also essential that the soil drains well. Cosmo flowers can tolerate both hot and dry weather. They can even endure drought. They will self-seed in your garden. Because of their tall stature, these plants may require staking in some cases. You can also grow them against a fence to provide support. Over-watering and over-fertilizing your cosmos may result in fewer flowers.

However, it would help if you did not transplant them, as they hate transplants. Instead, it would be best to plant them right where they will be grown. Sow one centimetre deep, five to ten centimetres apart, preferably in rows. To keep the soil moist, water your plants frequently with shallow water. This is especially important during germination. The soil needs to be watered every one to three days to promote germination. Carrot Autumn needs to keep the soil moist without drowning it.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF NANTES CARROTS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is usually not necessary to take special care of carrots. To ensure that carrot roots don't fork, remove all stones from the soil. Mulching is recommended, but carrots don't usually need additional feeding. Leaf mould or compost is a great organic mulch that blocks light and prevents the tops from turning green. Water the soil during dry weather to prevent it from drying out. To preserve moisture and nutrients, weeds must be controlled. Soon we will be able to harvest the fresh carrots.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HEALTH BENEFITS OF NANTES CARROTS</span></strong></h2>\n<p>The Nantes variety of carrots offers a range of health benefits. Carrots, in general, are renowned for their nutritional value and are considered a healthy vegetable choice. Nantes carrots, specifically, are packed with essential nutrients. They are notably rich in vitamin A, known for its potential benefits when consumed alongside dietary fats. Incorporating carrots into a balanced diet can be a nutritious and satisfying way to support healthy weight management. Nantes carrots are known for their crisp texture, delightful taste, and a wide array of beneficial nutrients.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Carrot Early Nantes </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zone: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">3-10</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fast Growing</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fertile</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Harvest Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">70-80 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Apiales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Apiaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Daucus </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> D.

The seeds usually germinate within five to fifteen days at 20 to 24 degrees C. Grow in warm, well-lit conditions, and keep the soil well fed. Allow the plants to acclimatize to outdoor conditions for 15-20 days before planting outside after all danger of frost has passed. Plant them 36 inches apart in full sun in a sheltered spot when the weather is warm.

Finally, please select the best Pumpkin from each plant and allow it to grow. Water and feed the plants regularly to have the best results.

It would be best if you planted each seed about one centimeter deep. Depending on how quickly you want them to grow, you can water them and put them in a propagator or a warm, south-facing windowsill. Courgettes can also be grown in an unheated greenhouse or polytunnel but must be protected from frost damage at night with fleece.</span></p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">COURGETTE</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When the seed is germinating, keep the compost moist but do not overwater. Put good quality multipurpose compost in 12cm pots. Make a hole in the compost in the large pot about the size of the smaller 7cm pot. Plant the seedling in the hole you made. Pack compost around the roots tightly to create a tight seal. You should water well and keep the plant indoors for a week or two. Keep the fleece on at night to be on the safe side.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SUNSTRIPE COURGETTE USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Probably not the first thing you think of when you think of superfoods, but pumpkins, squashes, and courgettes are! Nutrient-dense foods contain a wealth of essential nutrients, as well as being low in fat and sugar. Courgettes are a source of a mineral called potassium. To move around, we need potassium to keep our muscles working.

Direct sowing on the ground is less reliable than starting indoors. The best results can be achieved by maintaining a constant soil temperature of 15°C. Seeds should germinate in a week or two. The seeds of marjoram are dusty, so handle them with care. Use sterilized seed starting mix to prepare your containers or trays and water, then mix thoroughly. Then try to distribute the tiny seeds evenly on the surface of the wet soil. Avoid burying the seeds. During seedling growth, reduce watering so that the soil is only damp, not soaked.</p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </b><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">MARJORAM</b>\n</h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Sun and warmth are the best conditions for growing. Leave a gap of 25 cm between plants when thinned or transplanted. Cut back after flowering to prevent them from getting straggly. As autumn approaches, divide a few to keep indoors during the winter. For the rest of your plants, trim their growth to about 6cm from the soil. Water regularly, but do not overwater. Keep plants trimmed throughout the growing season by cutting the leaves. In order to stimulate new growth, cut back the plants to the ground when flower buds appear. Marjoram is a perennial plant that can be left in the ground in southern climates, Zone 9 and above. </p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">MARJORAM </b><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</b>\n</h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Cooks in North America and the Mediterranean use marjoram. Prepare vegetables, tomato-based dishes, stuffings, forcemeats, sausages, preserved meats, game, poultry, and pulses. Chop the leaves, but do not use the stems; add at the end of the cooking process. The herb marjoram is used in various traditional and folk remedies and has several benefits.

Growing them in a greenhouse or on a windowsill is also an option. Keep them protected and at a temperature of 18-20 degrees Celsius. Keep moisten, and germination will occur in about a week or two. To prevent damping off, water sparingly once the seeds have germinated. Each seedling should be transplanted to a small pot and grown for four weeks. You can either transplant a larger pot about 15cm wide or a garden, spacing plants every 25cm apart in 25cm rows.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR LEMON BASIL AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sunny, sheltered soil with good drainage is ideal for growing lemon basil. However, the midday sun is not suitable for the plant. It would help if you only planted in the garden after all danger of frost has passed - late May to early June. You can also sow directly in the soil when nighttime temperatures reach 13C around June, but the greenhouse method is more effective. You shouldn't overwater basil, but keep it moist and don't water the foliage. Be sure to wet in the morning rather than in the evening. To encourage bushy basil plants, pinch out growing tips two weeks after transplant. It would help if you cut basil before flowering, as this takes away from the taste.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF LEMON BASIL</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Only lemon basil is used much in Indonesian cuisine, where it is called kemangi. In Thailand, it's commonly eaten raw with salad or lalap (raw veggies) and sambal. Some Indonesian dishes, such as curries, soups, stews, and steamed or grilled dishes, are seasoned with lemon basil. Beta-carotene, a pigment that converts to vitamin A in the body to protect against blindness, is abundant in lemon basil. They are also high in vitamin K to aid in wound healing and magnesium, iron, manganese, copper, calcium, and vitamin C.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product Type: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lemon Basil Seed</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zone: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">9-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fast Growing</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fertile, Moist</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Harvest Season: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Late June</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lamiales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lamiaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ocimum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">O. africanum</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Use:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Beneficial Herb</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subspecies:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> D. c. subsp. sativus</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Garden Paradise Seeds sells the best seeds for growing healthy Aubergine Purple. It is sometimes possible to harvest them outside from the end of August if they are pre-planted in spring. You can pre-cultivate your seeds in your room in seed pots from February until mid-March. Please make sure the seed compost is evenly moist, and sow it 1.5 cm deep. At 20 - 25 ° Celsius, germination could take 15 - 30 days. Heat will be provided on the bottom of the seedling by a seed heating pad. Germination of this type of eggplant seed takes a few days. </span></p>\n<h2><b>CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF PURPLE EGGPLANT</b></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is best to incorporate compost before planting Aubergine Violetta di Firenze, as it prefers nutrient-rich soil. To grow healthy Aubergines, be sure that they get full sun six hours a day, and keep them moist. Water deeply and slowly once a week or more frequently during dry weather to keep the soil moist. You should avoid using deep digging tools since the roots are shallow and can be damaged by deep digging when the leaves are four-leafed, plant in pots, and place a light source underneath—a sheltered place with fertile soil around 20 degrees Celsius with full sun. Plant your seeds outdoors around mid-May at a distance of 60 x 80 cm.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">WHY SHOULD YOU PURPLE AUBERGINE</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From Italy comes the classic variety of Aubergine Purple.

When growing indoors, seedlings need protection for the first year, so timing the planting of the seeds does not have to be exact. Prepare a seed tray or shallow plant pot with seed starter soil mix. Germination of seeds requires light, so scatter the seeds over the soil. Barely cover with the soil mix. Put no more than 1/8 inch of soil on top of the seeds. Keep the soil moist. Water that is too cold will delay germination, while extremely hot water will cook the seeds. These seeds germinate best with high humidity, so cover the planting tray with a piece of clear plastic. Seeds germinate in one week under ideal growing conditions, but sprouts may not appear for up to four weeks.</span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </b><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">AGASTACHE</b>\n</h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the seeds have sprouted, the soil needs to remain moist. Their roots are tiny and dry out quickly, making the seedlings very tender. Seedlings can be transplanted into individual plant pots filled with potting soil once they have grown their first true leaves. Use a spoon to scoop the seedlings out with their roots intact and plant them in the center of the small plant pots. For the first year, keep seedlings indoors where they are warm and have bright light. Allow the Korean licorice mint to gradually adjust to outdoor temperatures by moving them outdoors for a few hours at a time until they are able to spend all day outdoors. This will take a few weeks. This plant does not grow well in shady areas and clayey soil. Once the weather has turned nice, transplant the plants outside in late spring or early summer. </span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">AGASTACHE </b><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</b>\n</h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Antioxidant polyphenols are abundant in Agastache.

The Mexican Agastache contains flavonoids such as acacetin and Italiani, which have anti-inflammatory properties that help prevent redness and inflammation caused by psychological stress and help reduce cellular inflammation.</span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><i data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Note:</i></b></span><i data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></i></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Specifications:</b></p>\n<ul data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Product type:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Agastache Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">USDA Zone: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4-10</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Feature:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fast Growing</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Soil:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fertile, Seed starter soil</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Harvest Time: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50-80 days</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Kingdom:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Scientific name: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agastache</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Higher classification: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nepetoideae</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Family: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lamiaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Rank: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genus</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Use:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Beneficial Herb</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

One to three weeks after germination, your bell pepper seedlings should sprout and be ready for transplanting outdoors. Adapting to a new environment after transplantation will take time. Bell peppers are especially vulnerable to transplant shock.</span></p>\n<h2><b>CARE FOR GREEN BELL PEPPERS AFTER GERMINATION</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you plant your seedlings, expose them to the outside environment for small amounts of time every day for ten days. Your green bell peppers are ready to be transplanted when the soil temperature reaches at least 20 degrees Celsius. Twenty-five to twenty-five inches apart is a good spacing for seedlings, and you should bury them in well-draining soil deep enough to cover their root balls but not so deep that their leaves touch the top layer. Their preference is for sandy or loamy soils that drain well and keep the ground warm. In order to keep them healthy, they need deep watering.</span></p>\n<h2><b>USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF GREEN BELL PEPPERS</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bright colors are added to salads, rooms, sides, and sandwiches with green bell pepper. You can also use them whenever you would use bell pepper in cooking. The extra taste makes it an excellent stuffing pepper, and it goes well with savory flavors. It can also be roasted or grilled. Bell peppers of all colors provide significant health benefits. In addition to being low in calories, they are full of vitamins. For example, they are a good source of vitamin C, potassium, and vitamin A. Additionally, bell peppers are a good fiber, folate, and iron source.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><b><i>Note:</i></b></span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Specifications:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Product:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Green Bell Pepper Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Season:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> July to September</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>USDA Zones:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 9-11</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Days to Harvest:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 60-90 days.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Soil Type:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Loamy</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Temperature:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 20-25 Degrees Celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Kingdom: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Scientific name: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capsicum annuum Group</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Scoville scale: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0 SHU</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Higher classification: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweet And chili pepper</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Rank: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cultivar group</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Recipes: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salad, stuffed, roasted, served in soups</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul></ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Once the ground is workable, direct sowing in the garden is recommended. However, if you want an earlier crop, you can start seeds indoors 4 to 6 weeks before your last spring frost date. After the soil reaches four °C, lettuce seeds can be sown, but germination occurs best between 13 and 18°C. Seedlings will typically emerge in a week to 10 days. After the transplants have been properly hardened off, they may be planted two to three weeks earlier than started indoors to have a continuous supply of lettuce and plant other seeds every two weeks after the initial planting.<br><br>\n</div>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></b></h2>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </b><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">ROMAINE LETTUCE</b>\n</h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Lettuce is a feeder. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting. Lettuce thrives in soils rich in organic material, with plenty of compost and a steady supply of nitrogen to keep it growing. Use organic alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer. Make sure the soil is moist but not too wet. The soil should drain well. You will know when to water lettuce. Just look at it! Sprinkle water on wilting leaves at any time, even in the heat of the day, to cool them off and slow down transpiration. In addition to row covers, lettuce can also be protected from drying out in the sun by using them. Organic mulch will help conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and keep soil temperatures cool in the summer.<br><br></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">ROMAINE LETTUCE </b><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</b>\n</h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Leafy purple vegetables are used in salads, cooked vegetable dishes, and sandwiches. When cooked, lettuce tends to develop a smoky flavour, something that's bound to make your dish tastier. You can also stir-fry your lettuce in a pan for a warm salad. There are numerous health benefits associated with lettuce, such as vitamin K and A. Inflammation may be controlled, body weight reduced, brain health promoted, and cardiovascular diseases may be reduced.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><i data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Note:</i></b></span><i data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></i></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Specifications:</b></p>\n<ul data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Product Type:</b> <span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Romaine Lettuce</span><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">USDA Zone: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8a</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Feature: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heavy Feeder</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Soil:</b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fertile, Moist, Cool</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Harvest Time: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 60-80 days</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Kingdom: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Scientific Name: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lactuca sativa var. longifolia</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Higher classification: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lettuces</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Family: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asteraceae</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Tribe: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cichorieae</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Genus: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lactuca</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Species: </b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">L.

Sow the seeds in the early spring or late autumn. Ideally, it would be best if you did not start the seeds until the soil temperature reaches 7 degrees Celsius. Fertile soil is necessary for seed propagation. Plant the seeds about two feet apart and about 1 cm deep when growing Kohlrabi from seeds. It is advisable to thin seedlings to a distance of 10 to 15 cm after they emerge after a week. It is possible to eat the tender young leaves of these plants, just like spinach or mustard greens.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></strong></h2>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR PURPLE KOHLRABI AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Maintain an even moisture level in the soil to encourage rapid growth. If water is not available, Kohlrabi will become woody. Use aged compost to prepare planting beds—side-dress Kohlrabi with aged compost once a month. A plant starter or balanced organic fertilizer can also feed Kohlrabi once a month. Cultivate carefully to avoid harming the shallow roots. Mulch kohlrabi plants with aged compost when they reach a height of 10-12 cm. Cutworms, cabbage loopers, and imported cabbage worms can attack Kohlrabi. Wrap collars around the seedling stem to protect them from cutworm damage. </span></p>\n<h2 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">PURPLE KOHLRABI USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</b></h2>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kohlrabi is an extremely healthy food. These cruciferous vegetables are cousins to Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, and kale and are rich in nutrients. In order to be a superfood, the item must be nutrient-rich, which Kohlrabi is.

The seeds can be sown directly in the garden between spring and autumn at temperatures between 7 and 24°C. It would help if you sowed seeds ten centimeters apart and half an inch deep—thin, successful seedlings at 30 to 45 centimeters intervals. Rows should be 45 to 76 centimeters apart. Heat can damage plants, so move them to the shade as soon as the weather warms up.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span><br>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span><br>\n</div>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CHINESE CABBAGE </span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Maintain an even moisture level in the soil so that plants proliferate and remain tender. A slow growth rate will cause the plants to go to seed. Maintain a cool climate when the weather warms up. Make sure Chinese cabbage does not spend more than eight hours in direct sunlight a day. Flea beetles, aphids, and cabbage worms can attack Chinese cabbage. You can handpick or hose off aphids. The spraying of Bacillus thuringiensis is effective for controlling cabbage worms.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CHINESE CABBAGE USAGE AND HEALTH BENEFITS </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Raw Chinese cabbages can be served in salads or slaws. When you chop the cabbage into thin strips, you can also add scallions, chili, julienned carrots, or other vegetables. The mixture should be topped with sesame oil, soy sauce, salt, and pepper. In terms of nutrition, Chinese cabbage contains significantly more vitamins and minerals than regular cabbage. Inflammation can be naturally reduced by eating Chinese cabbage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spring, Autumn</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 5-7</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 70-90 days.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Loamy</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 7-25 degrees Celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">(unranked):</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Angiosperms, Eudicots</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Brassicales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Brassicaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Brassica</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">B. oleracea</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Beneficial Vegetable</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Information:</span></strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ireland u0026amp; Northern Ireland:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Orders placed before 4 p.m. will be delivered the next day, otherwise usually two working days. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> From 2,00 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rest of the World :</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-11 Working Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From 2,90 Euros </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Except</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> for Australia u0026amp; New Zealand, shipping costs are from 3.50 Euros.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at<span> </span></span><b>Garden Paradise Seeds</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are dedicated to providing the best quality products with the best customer service in the entire market.

If your soil is impoverished, you can apply a balanced fertilizer to the planting site. It would be best if you planted chard seeds 2 to 3 weeks before the last frost date of the spring season. Seeds should be soaked in water for a day before planting to speed up germination. Sow the seeds an inch deep, space them two to six inches apart in rows, and space the rows about 18 inches apart. Chard seeds come in clusters of several seeds, which results in multiple seedlings sprouting from a single planting hole.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR WHITE SWISS CHARD AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Thin the plants to about six to eight inches apart once they reach about three to four inches tall. Chard will tolerate partial shade but thrives in full sun. You can snip them with scissors once they get at least five inches tall and eat the young seedlings as a snack! You can plant it again the following year. In this technique, more mature leaves are harvested from each plant at a time, allowing younger leaves to continue growing for additional harvests later in the season. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF SWISS CHARD TALL</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Including the leaves and stems, Swiss Chard is entirely edible. Because the stems have a lot of cellulose, they need to soften longer than the leaves. It takes the leaves less time to cook. Chard is a good source of vitamin C, and magnesium and a good source of vitamin A and K. Swiss chard also contain beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, antioxidants. It is vital for the normal development and maintenance of many organs, including the heart, lungs, and kidneys.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #088933;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Swiss Chard Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zone: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">2-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Maturity: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">50-60 Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Continuous summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 15-25 Degrees Celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fertile, Compost-mixed</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Higher classification: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Beet</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rank: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subspecies </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Use:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Healthy Veggies</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries:</strong> 3-7 working days. <br>Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world:</strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br>Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.</p>\n</div>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></span><br>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Ideally, direct sowing in the garden should be done once the ground is workable. Seeds can also be started a month indoors before your last frost date if you want an earlier crop. After the soil reaches 4 °C, lettuce seeds can be sown, but germination occurs best between 13 and 18°C. Seedlings will typically emerge in a week to 10 days. After the transplants have been properly hardened off, they may be planted two to three weeks earlier than started indoors to have a continuous supply of lettuce and plant other seeds every two weeks after the initial planting.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR ITALIAN LETTUCE AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It would help if you fertilized the plants three weeks after transplanting them. Compost, plenty of nitrogen, and a constant supply of organic matter are crucial for lettuce to thrive. Use organic alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer. Make sure the soil is moist but not too wet. The soil should drain well. You will know when to water lettuce. Just look at it! Sprinkle water on wilting leaves at any time, even in the heat of the day, to cool them off and slow down transpiration. They can also be used to protect lettuce from drying out in the sun, in addition to row covers. An organic mulch conserves moisture, suppresses weeds, and keeps soil temperatures cool in the summer.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF ITALIAN LETTUCE</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As an excellent green vegetable, lettuce is used in salads, cooked with vegetable dishes, and most commonly used on sandwiches. When harvesting, look for freshness, selecting lettuce that does not have wilted and discolored leaves. In addition to being packed with vitamins and minerals, salads can also boost your blood's antioxidant levels. Italian lettuce, the basis of any salad, provides a significant nutritional value.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Note:</span></em></strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product type: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Italian Lettuce Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zone: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">5 Above</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cold Tolerant</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fertile, Well Drained</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Harvest Season: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asterales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asteraceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tribe: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cichorieae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lactuca</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">L.

Outdoors, seed can either be sown in mid-spring after all dangers of frost have passed or in early fall to late winter. But winter sowing has advantages over spring sowing. In the wintertime, seeds are sown and germinate at the optimal time based on the weather conditions. They produce more challenging and more vigorous seedlings with higher germination rates than seeds sown indoors. Sow seeds six to eight weeks before the last frost. It would help fill small pots containing a light seed-starting mix lightly with the mixture. Sprinkle seeds on the soil's surface and then lightly scratch them in before watering. In colder temperatures, seeds can take up to fourteen days to germinate.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF BALM LEMON</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The time has come for the tiny plants to be cared for—plant seedlings into larger containers with their second pair of true leaves. Thin them to just one or two per pot after the second set of true leaves emerges. Lemon balm tends to sprawl and crawl, so make sure to leave plenty of room between it and nearby plants. Plants need to be controlled and kept tidy during the growing season by pinching or cutting back stem tips. If your mature plants are scraggly or spindly, divide them every three to five years. That will help plants to grow more.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">WHAT IS LEMON BALM, AND WHAT USAGE ITS HAVE?<br>\n</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br>Lemon balm, scientifically known as Melissa officinalis, is an herb from the mint family. It is widely recognized for its vibrant lemony scent and flavor. Lemon balm is often used in culinary applications to add a refreshing twist to various dishes, such as baked goods, teas, and marinades for chicken and fish. Its citrusy aroma makes it a popular choice for flavoring recipes.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br></p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>\n<strong>Product: </strong>Lemon<strong> </strong>Balm Seeds</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Winter</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-7</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 70 Days.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Crawler</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Loam</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Cold</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Lamiales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lamiaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Melissa </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">M.

Bush beans also need a long growing season. Direct sowing of soybean seeds is the best method of planting them in the garden. Spread soybean seeds about six inches apart in narrow rows, about an inch deep in the soil, and then cover them loosely with garden soil. Be sure to water well. It is essential that the soil is adequately moist and that there is no danger of frost when you plant. Spread out your planting times. After planting soybean seeds, sow them again about 10-12 days later to get a second harvest.</span></div>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></strong></h2>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR SOYBEAN AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Make sure the soil in the garden bed is moist so that the seeds can germinate and grow. Water them consistently (one inch of water weekly) and mulch to maintain soil moisture. In the garden, some plants complement each other well. In addition to absorbing nitrogen from the air and releasing it back into the soil, soybeans make good companion plants for heavy feeders like tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, cucumbers, corn, and potatoes. Soybean pods should be harvested when they appear full and plump.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF SOYBEAN</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Oil is extracted from soybeans (see uses below), and the meal is made from them (for animal feed). A smaller percentage is processed for human consumption into soy milk, soy flour, soy protein, tofu, and many other retail food items. Many industrial products (non-food) are also made with soybeans. A variety of health problems can be prevented by soy foods and soybeans, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), and some cancers. We can benefit from consuming one or two servings of soy products daily. Soy is a high-quality protein.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Soybean Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">  Spring 2 to 3 weeks</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 2-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">45-65 days.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Loamy</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 16-21 Degrees Celsius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">(unranked): </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Angiosperms, Eudicots, Rosids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fabales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fabaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subfamily: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Faboideae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Glycine</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">G. max</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

The previous fall, prepare the beds by working in manure or compost and raking smooth to leave a fine seedbed. Light is needed to germinate seeds, so sow at a shallow depth and cover with a thin layer of growing medium. Sow seed one cm deep and three centimetres apart in rows fifteen to thirty centimetres apart—delicate plants to 12-inch spacing after having two or three true leaves. You can broadcast seed in a patch rather than rows. <br><br></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span><br>\n</div>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF BUTTERHEAD LETTUCE </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Before transplanting, reduce water and temperature for three days to harden seedlings. Plant crispheads in rows 18 inches apart, spaced 12 inches apart. Row covers are used to protect young plants from cold, protect young plants from insects, and shade crops when warm weather arrives. Lettuce has a shallow root system. Maintain moist soil to keep plants growing continuously—mulch to keep moisture and prevent weed growth. Keep the soil moist but not soggy.</span></p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CRISPHEAD</span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> LETTUCE USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong><br>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When consumed regularly, lettuce can provide even more health benefits as part of a balanced diet.

Because the seeds need light to germinate, they can be sprinkled directly on the surface of the medium in flats or pots. Plants for the fall garden should be started by the first of July. You can place the pots in the refrigerator for a couple of weeks before sprouting, but it is unnecessary. Keeping the seeds moist, they should grow in three to five days and be ready for planting outside by August. <br><br></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></div>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF PINK KAMOME FLOWERING </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Depending on the variety's mature size, seedlings should be spaced from 30.5 to 51 cm apart. Kale should be planted, so the lowest leaves are flush with the ground. The primary consideration for flowering kale growing conditions is that the plants need cool weather to develop the best leaf color. It's best to plant them in the spring or fall because hot weather can inhibit leaf color and cause the stems to elongate. Kale often lasts through the winter months since it can withstand temperatures well below freezing. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><meta charset=\"UTF-8\">PINK KAMOME FLOWERING USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Flowering Kale and cabbage, also called ornamental cabbage and Kale, are two of the most colorful vegetables in the fall garden.

When planted too early, it is possible to have only small heads called buttons, or if planted too late and it matures in very warm or hot weather, no heads will form, and the plant will simply flower and go to seed. If you want to grow seedlings indoors, you'll need seed trays, potting mix, a grow light, and a window sill with a reliable amount of sunlight. In each cell of the seed trays, put two seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep and lightly cover with potting mix. It should take five to ten days until the seeds germinate after being moistened with a spray bottle. As soon as they germinate, set the seeds in that sunny windowsill or under your grow light for at least 8-10 hours a day. Let's move on to the next step.<br><br></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></strong><br>\n</div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR THE LITTLE BROCCOLI PLANTS<br></span></strong></h2>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></strong><br>\n</div>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Broccoli F1 Atlantis seeds Germinate at 10 - 25°C. To ensure the soil stays moist at all times, water the soil daily. Try to water in the early morning or evening to keep the water from evaporating too quickly. Keep them moist as soon as the seedlings sprout true leaves and are 4-6 inches tall. If you plan to grow them in containers, you'll need to transplant them outside in your garden. First, harden them off. You can do this by leaving them out for half an hour in a sheltered environment. Add one hour to the schedule the following day. Continue to leave them outside for an additional hour every day for the next few days until they have spent the entire day outdoors.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HARVESTING BROCCOLI HEADS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Now it's time to harvest. Ensure that the heads of broccoli F1 Atlantis are harvested when they are fully developed but with tight-closed buds. If they've begun to open up, the broccoli is still edible but not quite as good. The broccoli is too late to be saved once the flowers start to bloom. In the middle of summer, you should keep an eye on broccoli plants since they tend to bolt and go to seed if there is a heatwave. Try to stay on top of them and harvest them before this happens. Broccoli contains a whopping 220 percent of the recommended daily value in just one serving! It's been found that vitamin C may contribute to vascular health and maintain healthy skin and eyes. Therefore, it provides plenty of health benefits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"> </span>Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Winter</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-10</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 100-150 days.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 18-24 inches</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Moist</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 10-25 degrees Celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Brassica oleracea var. italica </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Higher classification: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Wild cabbage </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Origin: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Italy, more than 2,000 years ago </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rank: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Variety </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cultivar group:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> italica</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uses:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Beneficial Vegetable</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-7 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

To germinate Artemisia annua seeds, start by stratifying the seeds in the refrigerator for two weeks. This will break the seed dormancy and improve germination rates. After stratification, plant the seeds in well-draining soil, covering them lightly with soil. Water the soil gently and place the pot in a warm, bright location. Keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. The seeds should germinate within 7-10 days. Once the seedlings are a few inches tall, thin them out to prevent overcrowding and transplant them into individual pots or into the garden.</span></p>\n<h2><b>CARE FOR ARTEMISIA ANNUA PLANTS AFTER GERMINATION</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artemisia annua plants prefer consistently moist soil but do not tolerate waterlogged soil. Water the plants regularly, ensuring that the soil is moist but not saturated. In hot weather, the plants may need to be watered daily. Artemisia annua plants do not require heavy fertilization, but a light application of a balanced fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season can help promote healthy growth. To encourage bushier growth and prevent the plant from becoming too leggy, it is recommended to pinch back the tips of the stems once the plants are a few inches tall. This will encourage the plant to produce more lateral branches and foliage. Artemisia annua plants are relatively pest-resistant, but they can be susceptible to aphids and spider mites.</span></p>\n<h2>\n<b>USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF ARTEMISIA ANNUA</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>\n</h2>\n<p>Sweet Wormwood, has many applications and potential benefits. Among its notable components is artemisinin, a compound that has shown effectiveness in treating specific conditions. Furthermore, Artemisia annua has been utilized in traditional Chinese medicine to address various health issues. Another important use of artemisinin is its natural insecticidal properties, particularly in combating mosquitoes.

      "description": "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>HOW TO GERMINATE BLUE CORNFLOWER SEEDS</b></h1>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by preparing the soil. Cornflowers prefer well-draining soil, so it is best to add some sand or perlite to the soil to improve drainage. Sow the seeds in the soil at a depth of about 1/8 inch (3 mm). Cornflowers can be sown directly in the garden in early spring or late summer, or you can start them indoors about 6 to 8 weeks before the last frost. Keep the soil moist, but not waterlogged. Cornflowers prefer moderate moisture, so be sure to water regularly but don't let the soil become soggy. Germination typically takes 7 to 14 days. Once the seeds have sprouted, thin them out to about 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) apart.<br><br></span></div>\n<h2><b>CARE FOR BLUE CORNFLOWER PLANTS AFTER GERMINATION</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blue cornflowers prefer full sun, so be sure to plant them in a location that receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. Water the plants regularly, especially during hot and dry weather. However, make sure not to overwater them as this can lead to root rot. Cornflowers do not require much fertilization, but a light application of a balanced fertilizer can be applied in early spring to encourage healthy growth. To encourage more blooms, deadhead the flowers as they fade. This will also help prevent the plant from self-seeding and taking over the garden. They are relatively pest and disease-resistant, but they can be susceptible to powdery mildew in humid weather. </span></p>\n<h2><b>USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF BLUE CORNFLOWER</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blue Cornflower has been traditionally used to treat a range of health conditions, including inflammation, respiratory problems, digestive disorders, and eye infections. Blue Cornflower contains anti-inflammatory compounds that can help reduce inflammation in the body. It is often used topically to relieve skin irritations and rashes. Blue Cornflower has been used as an eyewash to treat conjunctivitis.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>Note:</i></b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></i></p>\n<h3><b>Specifications:</b></h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Common Name: Cornflower</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scientific Name: Centaurea cyanus</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Season: Summer</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feature: Blue or purple flowers, gray-green leaves</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use: Ornamental, medicinal, culinary</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More: Annual plant, attracts pollinators</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kingdom: Plantae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clade: Angiosperms</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Order: Asterales</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family: Asteraceae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subfamily: Cichorioideae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genus: Centaurea</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

They can be sown directly as well. If you prefer to plant seeds directly into the ground, you can do so once the soil has warmed to at least 16 degrees Celsius and can be worked. Scarification will accelerate the germination of morning glory seeds as the seeds are hard. The Seeds should be sown about a centimetre deep, a few inches apart. You don't have to be very particular about the spacing if you're planting a trellis. Soak the seeds well and water them well until they sprout.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR MORNING GLORY AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Morning glories are a favourite among gardeners everywhere for a good reason. They're very low-maintenance and attractive. Starting them from seed in early spring is easy, and you don't need to prune or deadhead them as they grow. Morning glories can start blooming with regular watering by mid-summer, but they can be slow to produce flowers. If you want your morning glory to grow well, it must be planted in a spot with plenty of sunlight. Only the flowers will open when they are facing the sun.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF MORNING GLORIES</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is one of a number of herbaceous twining vines or shrubs in the genus Ipomoea (family Convolvulaceae). The showy trumpet-shaped flowers and attractive leaves of morning glories make them famous for cultivation. In Asian and Mesoamerican countries, morning glory has been used as a laxative for centuries, and tea was sometimes made from its roots as a diuretic or expectorant. Herbal healers have also traditionally used tea brewed from dry leaves to treat headaches.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #00a719;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Morning glory</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> late spring or early summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 2-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 120 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">well-drained soil</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">18° degrees Celsius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific Name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ipomoea</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Solanales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Convolvulaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ipomoea</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">purpurea</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Plant seeds indoors in trays or pots with a good seed-starting mixture four to six weeks before your last spring frost. Make sure the seed does not get too moist. Make sure the seed is sown no more than 1 centimeter deep. The seedlings should be spaced 12 to 18 inches apart when they are a few inches tall. As soon as they reach three or four inches tall, move them into five-inch pots. Young plants can be planted outside as soon as the risk of frost has passed. It takes approximately seven weeks for the first bloom to appear when growing cosmos from seeds. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR WHITE COSMOS FLOWER MIDDLE AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The soil does not need to be prepared for Cosmos. Ideally, they prefer soil that is not too rich, as rich soil will promote foliage at the expense of blooms. It should, however, drain well. Cosmos are tolerant to hot, dry weather. Drought does not affect them. Self-seeding Cosmos can be found in any garden. Certain plants may require staking due to their height. Planting them next to a fence can also provide the necessary support. Overwatering and overfertilizing Cosmos will cause them to produce fewer flowers. Be careful not to do that. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF WHITE COSMOS MIDDLE</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You cannot have enough pollinators and predator insects in your garden for managing pests and pollinating your plants. Flowers attract beneficial insects like lacewings, parasitic wasps, tachinid flies, and hoverflies, which eat pest insects and pollinate them for free. It is not considered edible to eat Cosmos bipinnatus, the most common species.

African marigolds can also be planted in containers. You should prepare the soil approximately six inches deep a few weeks before you plan to grow by removing weeds and grass. Compost or other organic materials can provide nutrients to the soil as well. Once the last frost has passed, scatter seeds across the garden. The seeds germinate between 20 and 22 degrees celsius and emerge between 7 and 14 days after being planted. </span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR AFRICAN MARIGOLDS AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clay or dry soil is fine for African marigolds, but they prefer moist, well-draining soil. Regular watering helps to maintain moist but not soggy soil. When you notice water puddles or a squishy texture in the soil six hours after rain or watering, the soil is not draining, and your flowers may drown. As a result of drowning, the roots begin to rot, and the leaves become brown and die. Keeping your marigolds compact will prevent them from spreading out.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND BENEFITS OF AFRICAN MARIGOLD</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">African marigold is used externally for treating sores, ulcers, eczema, conjunctivitis, rheumatism, and sore eyes. Boils, carbuncles, and earaches can be treated externally with a paste made from the leaves. It is diuretic, carminative, and vermifuge. Mumps and colds can be treated with decoction. Marigold tea can be prepared from dried flowers. The flower petals can be dried at a low temperature and then boiled in water with a tablespoon of dried flowers added before the tea is brewed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0b7608;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> African marigold seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spring</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 2-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 4-6 weeks</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sandy or loamy soil</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">22 Degrees C</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific Name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tagetes erecta</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Asterales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Asteraceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subfamily: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asteroideae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tagetes</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Because zinnias are frost-sensitive, please wait until after the last frost before planting them. Find out when the first frost occurs in your area. Several weeks of sowing seeds every week can prolong the flowering period. Make sure you find a sunny spot. Good air circulation later in the season can help prevent foliar diseases such as powdery mildew. When it comes to soil conditions, zinnias do well in most, but the ideal soil is well-drained and rich in organic matter. Zinnia seeds should be sown about one centimeter deep. </span></p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR PINK ZINNIA </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">ELEGANS </span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PLANTS AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Typically, Zinnia seedlings appear within a week, but blooms may take up to several months, depending on the planting location and climate. Thinning seedlings when they reach three inches tall will maximize air circulation. Space them six to 18 inches apart. You can reduce the risk of powdery mildew by doing this. Fertilize lightly and water the soil moderately to maximize growth. Zinnias can be encouraged to bloom more by removing old blooms after they bloom. Zinnias are annuals, which die with the first hard frost in the fall. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF PINK ZINNIA ELEGANS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Many tribes in the Southwest use the flowers and leaves of Zinnia as herbal medicines and ritual herbs. In Navajo culture, Zinnia is regarded as a sacred medicine. Practically speaking, zinnias were also used to make brightly colored dyes and paints. Zinnias produce nectar-rich flowers from May until October, making them an excellent pollinator plant. They attract hummingbirds, Japanese beetles, ladybugs, and wasps as well. Among gardeners seeking easy-to-care-for flowers, zinnias are a perfect choice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0abf4e;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Pink Zinnia Elegans Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> June</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 2-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 60-70 days.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Organic matter and well-drained</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 21-26 Degrees Celsius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Asterales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asteraceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subfamily: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asteroidea</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Super Tribe: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Helianthodae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Zinnia</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

They should be planted one to two cm deep in full sunlight in compost-enriched soil. For harvesting the entire plant, space the plants 4-5\" apart. In order to harvest continuously the outer stalks, space the plants 8-10\" apart. For a continuous summer crop, plant seeds every two weeks. The seeds should germinate after a week. You can also plant Swiss chard in the fall because it can withstand light frosts.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR SWISS CHARD AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">With mulch, you can keep the soil moist and prevent weeds from growing. The seedlings are susceptible to moisture at the beginning of their growth. As soon as the leaves reach a height of 6-8\", they can be harvested for greens. The whole plant can be harvested at the soil surface but leave an inch of stem to ensure continued growth. Additionally, the outer stalks can be harvested while the inner stalks grow.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">YELLOW SWISS CHARD USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is often steamed or sauteed and can be added to soups, stews, casseroles, frittatas, and quiches. The young leaves are edible raw in salads. Chard always has green leaves, but the stalks vary in color. Swiss chard is a good source of vitamin C, magnesium, and vitamin A. In addition, beta-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin are antioxidants in Swiss chard. Vitamin A is essential for the normal development and maintenance of many organs, including the heart, lungs, and kidneys.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Swiss Chard, Mangold Seeds, </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zone: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">6-10</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Continuous summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Maturity:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 55 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Planting Depth:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> ¼.\"</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plant Spacing:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 6\"</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Row Spacing:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 18-24\"</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Growth Habit:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Upright</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Fertile, Compost-mixed</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Harvest Time: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">4-6 Weeks</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Higher classification: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Beet</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rank: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subspecies </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Use:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Healthy</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Information:</span></strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ireland u0026amp; Northern Ireland:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Orders placed before 4 p.m. will be delivered the next day, otherwise usually two working days. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> From 2,00 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rest of the World :</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-11 Working Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From 2,90 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">- Except</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> for Australia u0026amp; New Zealand, shipping costs are 3.50 Euros.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at<span> </span></span><b>Garden Paradise Seeds</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are dedicated to providing the best quality products with the best customer service in the entire market.

They also need regular watering to thrive. Keep the soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Avoid getting water on the leaves and stems, as this can increase the risk of fungal diseases. Cantaloupe melon plants benefit from regular fertilization to promote healthy growth and fruit production. Use a balanced fertilizer that is high in potassium, such as a 10-10-10 fertilizer, and apply it every 2-3 weeks during the growing season. The plants can be heavy and require support as they grow. Use a trellis, cage, or stake to support the plants and prevent them from falling over.

You can also plant them directly outdoors. Scarification will hasten the germination process for morning glory seeds, which are extremely hard. You can be rubbing them between two parts of coarse sandpaper for a few seconds and then soak them overnight. Spread the seeds about a few inches apart and about a quarter-inch deep. The seeds should be watered well after sprouting, and a moist environment should be maintained.</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR BLUE MORNING GLORY AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The best soil for morning glory plants is moist but drains well. You can still amend the soil later if the vines appear to be having difficulty. It would help if you watered your morning glories about one inch a week and mulched them around the roots to keep moisture in. You can slow your watering schedule once the plant is established (and in the winter), so it requires less water as it grows. Despite being hardy, early morning glory can survive cold and hot temperatures.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND BENEFITS OF BLUE MORNING GLORY</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">For centuries, morning glory roots have been used as diuretics and expectorants in Asian and Mesoamerican countries.

Use a container with good drainage and at least 12 inches deep to grow the taproot. Hollyhocks prefer well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter. Use a mixture of potting soil, perlite, and compost for the best results. Water the soil lightly after sowing the seeds and keep the soil consistently moist until germination. Hollyhock seeds germinate at 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24°C). The seeds can take up to two weeks to grow.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span><br>\n</div>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR WHITE HOLLYHOCKS PLANTS AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Once the seedlings have grown a few inches tall, they can be transplanted into larger containers or directly into the garden. Space the plants 18-24 inches apart. Water deeply but infrequently to encourage profound root growth. Let the soil dry out slightly before watering again. Hollyhocks prefer full sun but can tolerate some shade. Fertilize the plants once a month with a balanced fertilizer. Hollyhocks thrive in well-draining soil with total sun exposure. Hollyhocks can be prone to rust and fungal diseases. To prevent these issues, avoid overhead watering and space plants apart to increase airflow. If you notice signs of illness, remove affected leaves and dispose of them immediately.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND BENEFITS OF WHITE HOLLYHOCKS </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">White hollyhocks (Alcea rosea) have various uses and benefits. In traditional medicine, the plant has been used to treat multiple respiratory, digestive, and inflammation ailments. The flowers and leaves contain compounds that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is also used in skin care products due to its ability to soothe and hydrate the skin. The white hollyhock is also popular in ornamental gardening, adding a beautiful touch to cottage gardens and creating a lovely backdrop for other plants. The plant attracts butterflies and bees, making it a great addition to pollinator gardens.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><b><i>Note:</i></b></span><i><span> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></i></span></p>\n<p><b>Specifications:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name: White Hollyhocks</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scientific Name: Alcea rosea 'Alba'</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing Season: Summer</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soil Type: Well-draining, fertile</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunlight: Full sun to partial shade</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use: Ornamental plant</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kingdom: Plantae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clade: Angiosperms</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Order: Malvales</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family: Malvaceae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genus: Alcea</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\" data-mce-style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries:</strong> 3-7 working days. <br>Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world:</strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br>Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><br>At <strong>Garden Paradise Seeds</strong>, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Sow the seeds on the soil's surface and lightly press them down, then cover them with a thin layer of soil. It is essential to keep the soil moist but not over-watered and maintain a temperature range of 60-65°F (15-18°C) to promote proper germination, which usually takes 7-10 days. Once the seedlings appear, thin them to 6-8 inches apart to allow them room to grow.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR WHITE COMMON CORN-COCKLE PLANTS AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After germination, White Common Corn-Cockle plants should be transplanted into a sunny location with well-draining soil, either in a garden bed or container. Water the plants regularly, but avoid overwatering as they are prone to root rot. Fertilize the plants every 4-6 weeks with a balanced fertilizer to encourage healthy growth and flowering. These plants prefer full sun to partial shade and can be susceptible to pests like spider mites and aphids. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If pests are detected, it is essential to address the problem promptly. In the summer, White Common Corn-Cockle plants produce lovely white or pink flowers that can be cut for floral arrangements or enjoyed in the garden.

Purple Allium Hollandicum is a hardy perennial that can survive cold winters. In late fall, cut back the foliage to about 2 inches above the ground and cover the plants with mulch to protect them from freezing temperatures.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND BENEFITS OF PURPLE ALLIUM HOLLANDICUM</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Alliums, including Purple Allium Hollandicum, contain compounds that have antimicrobial properties. These compounds may help fight off harmful bacteria and viruses. Some studies suggest that alliums may have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular health. For example, one study found that consuming garlic (another Allium family member) can lower blood pressure. Alliums contain compounds that have anti-inflammatory properties. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Inflammation is a natural response to injury or infection, but chronic inflammation can contribute to the developing of several diseases, including arthritis, heart disease, and cancer. Alliums contain sulfur compounds that may help prevent cancer. For example, one study found that consuming garlic and other alliums can reduce the risk of certain types of cancer, including stomach and colorectal cancer.</span></p>\n<p><span><b><i><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\">Note</span>:</i></b><i> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</i></span></p>\n<p><b>Specifications:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scientific Name: Allium hollandicum 'Purple Sensation'</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing Season: Perennial</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soil Type: Well-draining, fertile soil</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunlight: Full sun to partial shade</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use: Ornamental plant in garden beds, borders, and containers</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kingdom: Plantae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clade: Tracheophytes</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Order: Asparagales</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family: Amaryllidaceae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genus: Allium</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Species: Allium hollandicum</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

However, you should do it between four and six weeks before the later frost date. Alternatively, you can plant them directly outdoors. Morning glory seeds are difficult to germinate, and scarification accelerates the germination process. Afterward, rub them between two pieces of coarse sandpaper for a few seconds before soaking them overnight. Plant seeds about a quarter-inch deep and a few inches apart. Maintaining a moist environment is imperative after sprouting seeds.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR PINK MORNING GLORY AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is ideal for morning glory plants to grow in moist but well-draining soil. Despite poor vine growth, it is still possible to amend the soil. Morning glories can be kept moist by watering them about an inch a week and mulching the roots. As the plant grows, you can reduce its watering schedule once it has been established (and in the winter). Early morning glory is tolerant of both cold and heat, despite its hardiness.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND BENEFITS OF PINK MORNING GLORY</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Asian and Mesoamerican countries have used morning glory roots as diuretics and expectorants for centuries. Herbalists also use the leaves to relieve headaches by brewing tea from them. In addition to being a diuretic, anthelmintic, blood purifier, deobstruent, laxative, carminative, and anti-inflammatory plant, it is also used to treat abdominal disorders, fevers, headaches and much more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #05a323;\"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Pink Morning Glory Flower Seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Spring or early summer</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 2-11</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">: 120 days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Well-drained soil</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">18° degrees Celsius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientific Name: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ipomoea</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tracheophytes, Eudicots, Asterids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Solanales</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Convolvulaceae</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ipomoea</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Purpurea</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Aster plants should be placed where they will not be exposed to midday sun in warmer temperatures. Choose a sunny location. A loamy soil should be moist but well-drained. Before planting, mix compost into the soil. You can start seeds indoors during the winter by planting them in pots or flats and holding them in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 weeks to simulate winter dormancy. Germination is boosted during this period of cold weather. A sunny spot in your home is the best place to plant seeds an inch deep in the soil.

Aster plants should be spaced 1 to 3 feet apart, depending on the type and size of the plant. Make sure to provide plants plenty of water when they are planted. Mulch the soil after planting to keep it cool and prevent weed growth. Asters are beautiful to pollinators, including bees and butterflies. If your plants are losing flowers, you should keep an eye out for stressed plants and attempt a different watering method. Stagger tall plants to prevent them from falling over.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF WHITE ASTER </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can eat the blooms and leaves fresh or dried when eating aster plants. Aster root would be applied topically to relieve headaches by the Ojibwa. Aster flowers were also used for treating venereal diseases. The white color of asters symbolizes innocence. The red color of asters represents devotion. The pink color of asters symbolizes sensitivity and love. Asters and goldenrods attract many pollinating insects late in the season.

It is a fine idea to plant seeds outdoors in well-prepared soil or pots filled with multipurpose compost early in the summer. The seeds should be thinly sown in well-drained soil and lightly covered. Germination will usually take between 7-20 days. For a constant supply of leaves, plant every three to four weeks. You must thin your seedlings so that there is a gap of 10cm between plants and ensure that they are in a sunny spot. Keeping the seed moist and well covered is part of the benefits of sowing undercover. The coriander seeds will propagate at 15-18° celsius.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR SMALL LEAF CORIANDER AFTER GERMINATION </span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In a few days, the Coriander Seeds will start to germinate. Moisture should be maintained in soil and compost, but overwatering should be avoided. Premature flowering can be caused by dry soil or compost. Plants usually are not fed, but occasionally providing them some liquid fertilizer can be helpful. Plants that produce seeds should be weeded regularly to prevent a halt in their growth. Make sure the humidity level remains the same.</span></p>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HEALTH BENEFITS OF SMALL LEAF CORIANDER</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span>\n</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Coriander is a herb with many health benefits. Not just does it taste great, but it's also rich in antioxidants, beta-carotene, and folate. When your cells are protected from oxidative stress, your skin feels soft, supple, and glowing.

The goal is to achieve moderately fertile conditions in a well-drained area that receives full sun to partial shade. You can dig shallow trenches a few inches deep with your fingers. Separate the trenches ten to twenty-five inches apart. Plant Purple Top Turnip seeds about an inch apart in the trenches four to six weeks before the last frost and cover lightly with soil. Harvest should occur in late spring. Purple top and other turnip varieties grow best in temperatures from 20 to 30 degrees Celsius during the day. Alternatively, sow the turnip seeds in late summer for a fall harvest after high temperatures have passed. In regions with cooler summers, sow them every two weeks through the middle of the summer for a continuous yield.</div>\n<h2>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></strong><br>\n</h2>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR PURPLE TURNIPS AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p>When they are a few inches tall and thin, the turnip sprouts 4 to 6 inches apart, keeping the toughest ones. To protect the top of the tubers from harsh sun, mulch the purple top plants with straw. Keep the soil continually moist by watering the purple top plants regularly. The tubers grow most quickly and tenderly when the soil is constantly wet. Do not allow the soil to dry out. Halfway through the growing season, side-dresses the purple tops with compost by spreading it between the rows next to the plants. Keep the turnip bed weeded constantly. The roots of weeds can lead to small purple top tubers and encourage pest infestations.</p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF PURPLE TURNIP </span></strong></h2>\n<p>Purple turnips, known as Purple Top Turnips, offer a variety of culinary uses and potential health benefits. When preparing these turnips, they can be baked or boiled and incorporated into stews, soups, or stir-fries, adding depth and flavor to your dishes. Alternatively, lightly steam them and enhance their taste with butter, salt, or a squeeze of lemon juice.<br><br>For a creative twist, consider using purple turnips in your coleslaw. You can add a vibrant and nutritious element to this classic dish by peeling and julienning them. Additionally, turmeric can serve as an excellent matchstick garnish, providing a visually appealing and flavorful combination.</p>\n<div class=\"group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]\">\n<div class=\"flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto\">\n<div class=\"relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light\">\n<p>It is worth noting that while purple turnips can be a valuable addition to a balanced diet, specific health benefits should be approached with discretion.

Sow a generous amount of compost into the planting area before raking it to a fine, crumbly texture, then dig a 5 cm deep drill with 25 cm between each, or make double rows 15 cm apart. Due to the large size of the seeds, Broad Beans are easy to plant. The seeds should be spaced 25 cm apart along the length of the drill. Cover the seeds with soil, firm them down, and water well. It's a good idea to sow broad beans in deep pots or modules if you live in a cold climate, have heavy or waterlogged soil, or have mice that eat the seeds. Broad Bean Masterpiece will germinate within three weeks. Once roots have filled their pot, plant them out after six weeks. Let's talk after the seeds have germinated.<br><br></span></div>\n<h2>\n<b>CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </b><b>BROAD BEAN SEEDS</b>\n</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hurrah! Your little seeds of Broad Bean Masterpiece are gonna germinate soon. In order to protect the seeds from birds and squirrels, cover the newly sown area with netting. As soon as the weather and soil conditions permit, seedlings should appear. Keep the plants well-watered and free of weeds. When planting broad beans, keep them reasonably close together or in two rows rather than using canes to support them. Even taller varieties remain in mutual support thanks to a space of just 25 cm between them. This is how you can take care of your seedlings. The green beans will be ready in three months. In addition, Broad beans provide smaller amounts of almost all other B vitamins, calcium, and<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> selenium.</span></span></p>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"color: #ea3520;\">Features:</span></strong> </em>Broad Beans are super beneficial for your health. 170 grams of cooked Broad beans contain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Calories:</strong><span> </span>187 calories</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Carbs:</strong><span> </span>33 grams</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fat:</strong><span> </span>Less than 1 gram</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Protein:</strong><span> </span>13 grams</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fiber:</strong><span> </span>9 grams</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Folate:</strong><span> </span>40% DV</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Manganese:</strong><span> </span>36% DV</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Copper:</strong><span> </span>22% DV</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Phosphorous:</strong><span> </span>21%  DV</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Magnesium:</strong><span> </span>18% DV</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Iron:</strong><span> </span>14% DV</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Potassium:</strong><span> </span>13% DV</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Thiamine and Zinc:</strong><span> </span>11% DV</li>\n<li>\n<b>Kingdom: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Clade:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Rosids</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Order:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fabales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Family: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fabaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Tribe:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fabeae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Genus: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vicia </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Species: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V. faba</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Usage: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beneficial Vegetable</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-7 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At</span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Here is a guideline on how to grow Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds: <br></p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Seed Scarification:</strong> Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds have a hard outer coat that can hinder germination. To enhance germination, it is recommended to scarify the seeds before planting. You can achieve this by gently scratching the seed coat using sandpaper or making a small nick with a knife. Be careful not to damage the embryo inside.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Seed Soaking:</strong> Soak the seeds in warm water for approximately 24 hours after scarification. This process helps soften the seed coat and promote moisture absorption, aiding germination.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Prepare a well-draining potting mix by combining equal parts of garden soil, compost, and sand. This mixture provides the necessary nutrients and aeration for healthy root development.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Planting:</strong> Fill small pots or seed trays with the prepared potting mix. Plant the scarified seeds about 1/4 inch deep into the soil, ensuring they are spaced at least 2 inches apart. Gently cover the seeds with soil and lightly pat it down.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Optimal Conditions:</strong> Place the pots or trays in a warm and sunny location, preferably between 70-85°F (21-29°C). Provide indirect sunlight or use grow lights if natural light is insufficient. Maintain a consistent moisture level in the soil, ensuring it remains moist but not overly saturated.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Germination and Growth:</strong> Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds may take some time to germinate, usually within 2-4 weeks. Once germination occurs, provide adequate sunlight, water, and nutrients. As the seedlings grow, thin them out if needed, allowing sufficient space for each plant to develop.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Transplanting:</strong> Once the seedlings have grown a few sets of true leaves and the risk of frost has passed, they can be transplanted into larger containers or directly into the garden. Choose a location with well-draining soil and provide support, such as a trellis or fence for the climbing vines.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Care and Maintenance:</strong> Regularly water the plants, ensuring the soil remains evenly moist. Fertilize periodically with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Monitor for pests or diseases and take appropriate measures if necessary.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Harvesting:</strong> Hawaiian Baby Woodrose plants typically start producing flowers after several months. Once the flowers have bloomed and formed seed pods, allow them to mature and dry on the plant. Harvest the seeds by removing the dry pods and collecting the seeds for future use or propagation.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is important to note that Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds contain natural compounds that have psychoactive properties.

Avoid overwatering, as excessive moisture can lead to root rot. Check the soil's moisture level by inserting your finger into the top inch of the soil and water when it feels slightly dry.<br><br></span></li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Transplanting</strong>: Once the seedlings have grown a few sets of true leaves and are strong enough to handle, they can be transplanted into larger containers or directly into the garden. Ensure the planting location has well-draining soil and sufficient plant space to grow.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Soil and Fertilizer:</strong> Use a well-draining potting mix or amend the garden soil with organic matter to improve drainage. Fertilize the plants with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer at a diluted strength according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apply the fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the growing season to provide essential nutrients.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Support:</strong> As the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose plants grow, they develop climbing vines that require support. Install a trellis, fence, or other suitable structures for the vines to climb and twine around.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Pruning:</strong> Regularly inspect the plants and remove any dead or damaged leaves. Prune the plants if they become unruly or promote bushier growth. Pinching off the growing tips can encourage branching and a fuller appearance.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Pest and Disease Control:</strong> Monitor the plants for signs of pests or diseases, such as aphids or fungal infections. If detected, take appropriate measures to control and treat the issue. Use organic methods whenever possible to minimize chemical exposure.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Harvesting:</strong> Hawaiian Baby Woodrose plants typically start producing flowers after several months.

While it is important to note that I can provide information about traditional and historical uses, consulting with a qualified professional or herbalist for personalized advice is always recommended. Here are some of the benefits and uses associated with Elephant Creepers:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Psychoactive Properties:</strong> Elephant Creeper contains naturally occurring psychoactive compounds, particularly in its seeds, such as lysergic acid amide (LSA) and ergoline alkaloids. These compounds have been reported to have hallucinogenic and mind-altering effects. However, it is essential to note that these effects can vary significantly among individuals and may also come with potential risks and side effects.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Spiritual and Shamanic Practices:</strong> In certain spiritual and shamanic practices, Elephant Creeper has been used for its psychoactive properties to induce altered states of consciousness, facilitate spiritual experiences, and aid in rituals or ceremonies. Again, it is crucial to approach such practices with caution and respect for cultural traditions and legal regulations.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Ornamental Plant:</strong> Elephant Creeper is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and showy flowers.

Purple Convolvulus Tricolor seeds should be sown directly into the soil in a sunny location after the last frost or started indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date. When sowing directly into the soil, make shallow rows with a garden hoe or trowel and plant the seeds 1/4 inch deep and 4 to 6 inches apart. The seeds germinate best when the soil temperature is between 60 to 70°F (15-21°C). Water the soil gently to keep it moist but not soaking wet. The seeds will usually germinate within 10 to 14 days.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR PURPLE CONVOLVULUS TRICOLOR PLANTS AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After the seeds have germinated, the seedlings should be thinned out to a spacing of about 8 to 12 inches apart. The plants prefer full sun but can tolerate some shade. Water the plants regularly, about once a week, but avoid overwatering. Too much water can cause the roots to rot. Fertilize the plants every four weeks with a balanced fertilizer. Deadhead the flowers regularly to encourage more blooms. Purple Convolvulus Tricolor is a beautiful and easy-to-grow annual plant that can be used for ornamental purposes. Its bright, funnel-shaped flowers are a deep shade of purple with white and yellow centres, and they bloom throughout the summer months.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND BENEFITS OF PURPLE CONVOLVULUS TRICOLOR</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The plant is commonly used in borders, rock gardens, and containers. It can also be used as a ground cover or trailing plant in hanging baskets. Aside from its decorative value, Purple Convolvulus Tricolor is believed to have some medicinal properties. Traditional medicine has used it to treat respiratory conditions, digestive problems, and skin irritations. The plant contains flavonoids, antioxidants that may help reduce inflammation and protect against cell damage. </span></p>\n<p><b style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\"><i><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\">Note</span>:</i></b><i style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</i><br></p>\n<p><b>Specifications:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scientific Name: Convolvulus tricolor</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing Season: Annual</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soil Type: Well-draining, sandy loam soil</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunlight: Full sun to partial shade</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use: Ornamental plant</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kingdom: Plantae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clade: Tracheophytes</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Order: Solanales</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family: Convolvulaceae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genus: Convolvulus</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Species: Convolvulus tricolor</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Asters don't need much fertilizer, but you can apply a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer once a month during the growing season to encourage healthy growth. Pinch back the tips of the stems when the plants are about 6 inches tall to encourage branching and bushier growth. Asters are susceptible to fungal diseases like powdery mildew, so avoid overhead watering and provide good air circulation around the plants to prevent disease.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND BENEFITS OF PURPLE-WHITE ASTER</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Purple-white aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae) has several uses and benefits. Purple-white aster is a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. It produces beautiful, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple and white, which can brighten any garden. Purple-white aster is an excellent plant for attracting pollinators to the garden, such as bees, butterflies, and other beneficial insects. These insects play a crucial role in pollinating plants and promoting biodiversity. Some Native American tribes used aster for medicinal purposes, such as treating respiratory illnesses, coughs, and fevers. </span></p>\n<p><span><b><i><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\">Note</span>:</i></b><i> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</i></span></p>\n<p><b>Specifications:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common Name: Purple White Aster</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scientific Name: Aster novae-angliae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing Season: Perennial</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soil Type: Well-draining, fertile soil</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunlight: Full sun to partial shade</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watering: Keep soil evenly moist</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Temperature: Cool to moderate temperatures</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Days to Germinate: 10-21 days</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use: Ornamental plant, pollinator attractant</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kingdom: Plantae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clade: Angiosperms</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Order: Asterales</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family: Asteraceae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genus: Aster</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

      "description": "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>HOW TO GERMINATE CRIMSON CLOVER SEEDS</b></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To germinate Crimson Clover seeds, prepare the planting area by removing weeds and loosening the soil to a depth of at least 6 inches. Sow the seeds at a depth of ¼ to ½ inch, and space them about 2 inches apart. The ideal time to plant Crimson Clover seeds is in the fall or early spring, as they prefer cooler temperatures for germination. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Once planted, water the area gently to moisten the soil. The seeds should be moist but not waterlogged, so water regularly and avoid overwatering. Crimson Clover seeds prefer full sun but can also tolerate partial shade. The germination period for Crimson Clover seeds typically takes 7-10 days.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR CRIMSON CLOVER PLANTS AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After germination, care for Crimson Clover plants by providing adequate water and sunlight. Water the plants regularly, but be careful not to overwater, as this can cause root rot. Ensure the soil is moist but not soggy. Crimson Clover plants prefer full sun to partial shade and can tolerate a range of soil types. Fertilization is not typically necessary, as Crimson Clover is a nitrogen-fixing plant that can add nutrients to the soil. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, a balanced fertiliser can be applied if the plants appear to be struggling. Crimson Clover is an annual plant that does not need to be transplanted. Once the plants have finished blooming, they can be left in the soil to decompose, adding nutrients for future plants.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND BENEFITS OF CRIMSON CLOVER</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crimson Clover is a beneficial plant commonly used as a cover, pasture, or forage crop. As a cover crop, it helps to prevent soil erosion, improve soil fertility, and suppress weeds. Crimson Clover is also a nitrogen-fixing plant, which means it can convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form available to other plants. As a result, it can help to enrich the soil with nitrogen, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crimson Clover is also commonly used as a forage crop for livestock, as it is high in protein and other nutrients. It can be grazed by animals or harvested and used as hay. Additionally, the flowers of Crimson Clover are an essential source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, making it a beneficial plant for supporting biodiversity.</span></p>\n<p><b><i><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\">Note</span>:</i></b><i><span> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></i></p>\n<h3><b>Specifications:</b></h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common Name: Crimson clover</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scientific Name: Trifolium incarnatum</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing Season: Annual</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soil Type: Well-draining, loamy soil</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunlight: Full sun to partial shade</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use: Cover crop, forage, soil improvement</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kingdom: Plantae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clade: Angiosperms</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Order: Fabales</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family: Fabaceae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subfamily: Faboideae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genus: Trifolium</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

After soaking, any remaining fruit flesh should be removed and the seeds rinsed in clean water. The seeds can then be planted in a container filled with moist, well-draining soil and covered with a thin layer of soil. It is important to keep the soil consistently moist and warm, ideally around 85-90°F, to promote germination.

The plants should be watered regularly, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Fertilizer should be applied every 3-4 months with a balanced fertilizer to promote healthy growth. The plants require plenty of sunlight, ideally around 6-8 hours per day, to thrive. Weeds and pests around the plants should be controlled to prevent damage. Any damaged or dead fronds should be pruned from the plant to keep it healthy. It is important to note that African oil palm cultivation has been associated with negative environmental impacts, such as deforestation and loss of biodiversity.</span></p>\n<h2><b>USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF AFRICAN OIL PALM</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is primarily cultivated for its fruit, which is processed into palm oil. Palm oil is widely used in the food industry for cooking oil, margarine, and other products. Palm oil is also used in non-food products such as soap, cosmetics, and biofuels. In addition to its commercial uses, African oil palm has some potential health benefits. Palm oil contains a high percentage of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, which may help improve cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. In traditional medicine, African oil palm has been used to treat a range of ailments such as malaria, infections, and stomach problems, although more research is needed to confirm these traditional uses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the cultivation of African oil palm has been associated with negative environmental impacts, such as deforestation, habitat destruction, and loss of biodiversity.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>Note:</i></b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></i></p>\n<h3><b>Specifications:</b></h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common Name: African oil palm</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scientific Name: Elaeis guineensis</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Season: Year-round</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feature: Large, palmate leaves and fruit clusters</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use: Commercial production of palm oil</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More: Native to West and Central Africa</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kingdom: Plantae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clade: Angiosperms</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Order: Arecales</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family: Arecaceae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subfamily: Arecoideae</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genus: Elaeis</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br>Shipping cost from: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br>Shipping cost from: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Incorporate slow-release fertilizer into compost if it is available in 9cm pots. As they grow, pot them into their final growing container once they are about 20 cm tall. Pepper plants are best grown in large containers for ease of maintenance. A minimum diameter of 30cm is recommended. You can stake the plants with a cane to provide them with some support. After fruiting, place the plant back in a warm, light position and keep frost-free once more.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND BENEFITS OF YELLOW SWEET PEPPER</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Raw or cooked, sweet peppers are delicious.

Seeds should be sown in October, November, or December, or late in January or February. In a 20°C environment, it germinates. In small pots or cell packs, plant seeds 1/4 inch deep. Place them on a refrigerator or heat mats in a warm spot, cover them loosely with plastic or a seedling bag to retain moisture. Ensure that the soil is moist. A plastic dome or bag should show condensation inside. Unless you do, you should mist the seeds lightly to prevent them from falling. Without additional heat, the seeds will sprout, but the process will take longer. Adding heat to the seeds will help them germinate faster.<br><br></span></div>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE AFTER GERMINATION EGGPLANT</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Germination of Aubergine seeds generally takes a week or two. Place your pot or flat in a bright window or under lights once the seeds have germinated. Keep your eggplant seeds moist as they grow over the next eight to ten weeks. Plant 3-4 inch-high plants into 9-inch pots or three plants per grow bag under glass when they are 3-4 inches high. You can transplant outdoor plants to a sheltered spot in the sun. It is recommended that pH levels are from 6.5 to 6, and the N, P, K, and magnesium indices should range from 3 to 3.5. The next 80 days will bring its harvest. It's not difficult to grow some awesome-looking aubergines.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SOME TIPS AND TRICKS FOR BLACK EGGPLANT</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Support the plants with vertical strings or canes and horizontal ties or loops to prevent them from sprawling. Prune - There is no need to take more than one plant stem, as you can cut side shoots past the flowers that form. Plants with fewer than nine fruits per plant are generally considered to be successful, but in longer-term cultures, this number can be exceeded.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #ff2a00;\">Note</span>:</span></em></strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifications:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Product: </span></strong>Aubergine Seeds, Eggplant Seeds</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Season:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Any</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USDA Zones:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 5-12</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Days to Harvest:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 80 Days.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Height:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 24-36 inches</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil Type:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Loam</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Temperature:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 20 Degree Celcius</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kingdom: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clade:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Asterids </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Solanales </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Solanaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Genus:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Solanum </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Species: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">S. melongena</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Recipes: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">grilled, stuffed, roasted, served in soups</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Information:</span></strong><br>\n</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ireland u0026amp; Northern Ireland:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Orders placed before 4 p.m. will be delivered the next day, otherwise usually two working days. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> From 2,00 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rest of the World :</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 3-11 Working Days</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shipping Cost: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From 2,90 Euros</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">- Except</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> for Australia u0026amp; New Zealand, shipping costs are from 3.50 Euros.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at </span><b>Garden Paradise Seeds</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are dedicated to providing the best quality products with the best customer service in the entire market.

It is recommended that fresh material be used for growing Chocolate Hibiscus since seeds fast lose their viability. Seeds that have been soaked in water for one to two days are more likely to germinate, and seed germination usually begins within nine days after soaking. Germination is more rapid, and the final germination percentage is higher at a temperature of 33 degrees celsius than at 20 and 25 degrees celsius. Now let's know how to care for the growing plants.</p>\n<h2>\n<b>CARE AFTER GERMINATION OF </b><b>CHOCOLATE HIBISCUS</b>\n</h2>\n<p>Two weddings are usually sufficient for Abroma Augusta to produce its best result. Approximately twenty to thirty days after sowing and about a month later. Daily watering is needed for Abroma Augusta but make sure you don't make the soil soggy. In general, sowing 7 cm deep produces better results than sowing less deeply. Make soil prepared before sowing the seeds. It will make the growing better. Overplanting causes plants to branch excessively. Plants shouldn't be too close together or too wide apart.</p>\n<h2>\n<b>ABROMA AUGUSTA </b><b>HIBISCUS</b><b> BENEFITS</b>\n</h2>\n<p>Those experiencing abdominal pains and pain in the pelvis due to the absence of menstruation may benefit from chocolate hibiscus. The drug also effectively treats diabetes insipidus—diabetic complications, albuminuria, enuresis, debility, vertigo, sleeplessness, carbuncles, and amenorrhea. As well as sleeping disorders, rheumatism, fever, and abnormal vaginal discharges, Abroma Augusta can also treat these conditions. Overall it has a lot of benefits. </p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Note:</strong></span> Information provided for guidance only, as cultural practices and climatic circumstances vary.</em></span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Specifications:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Plant Name:<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> </span></b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> Chocolate Hibiscus, Abroma Augusta</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Seeds per pack:<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> </span></b>15<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> seeds</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<b data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Feature:<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> </span></b><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Less Caring</span>\n</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Soil:</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> </span>Fertile and Prepared</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<b>Germination: </b>﻿20-25 degrees celsius</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Kingdom: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plantae </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Clade: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tracheophytes, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Rosids </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Order:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malvales </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Family:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Malvaceae </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Subfamily:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Malvoideae </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Tribe: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hibisceae</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Genus: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hibiscus </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Species:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> H. sabdariffa</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shipping Information</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>European countries: </strong> 3-10 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.50 EUR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rest of the world: </strong> 3 to 14 working days. <br> Shipping cost: 3.95 Euros.<br><br><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Garden Paradise Seeds</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">, our commitment is to deliver top-quality products accompanied by unparalleled customer service.

Allow the topsoil to dry out slightly before watering again. After the plant has established itself, fertilize it once a month during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer. Prune any damaged or yellowed leaves and trim any brown tips to maintain the plant's appearance. Once the plant has outgrown its container, transplant it into a larger pot with fresh potting mix or into the ground outside. Choose a location with well-draining soil and ample space for the plant to grow. Keep an eye out for any signs of infestation and treat as needed with appropriate insecticides or insecticidal soap.</span></p>\n<h2><b>USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF LIVISTONA CHINENSIS</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Livistona chinensis, also known as Chinese fan palm, is a palm tree that is native to East Asia. Livistona chinensis is commonly grown as an ornamental plant in gardens, parks, and indoor spaces due to its attractive, fan-shaped leaves and low maintenance requirements.

You will get the best from us. Soak the seeds in room temperature water for 24-48 hours. This will soften the seed coat and make it easier for the seedling to emerge. Fill a seed tray or small pots with a well-draining potting mix. Moisten the soil with water, but avoid making it too wet, which can lead to fungal growth. Place one or two seeds in each pot and cover them with a thin layer of soil. The seeds should be planted about 2-3 centimeters deep. Place the seed tray or pots in a warm, humid location like a greenhouse or a warm, sheltered spot indoors. Keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. Germination can take 1-3 months, depending on the temperature and humidity levels. Be patient and avoid disturbing the seeds or soil during this time. </span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CARE FOR CARYOTA OCHLANDRA PLANT AFTER GERMINATION</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Once the seedlings have grown to about 10-15 centimeters tall, they can be transplanted into larger pots or the ground. Be sure to choose a location with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Keep the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged. Caryota ochlandra prefers consistently moist soil, but it is essential to avoid overwatering, which can cause root rot. Apply a balanced fertilizer every 2-3 months during the growing season to provide crucial nutrients for healthy growth. Caryota ochlandra plants prefer bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch the leaves. This plant prefers warm and humid conditions, so it is best to keep it in a location with temperatures between 18-27°C and high humidity levels. As the plant grows, it may need to be repotted into a larger container with fresh soil.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">USES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF CARYOTA OCHLANDRA</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The fishtail palm is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and impressive size.
